# Applied Statistics : MCQ

>[!math]- Question 1
>>[!faq]- Which distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials?
>> - [ ] a) Poisson
>> - [ ] b) Geometric
>> - [ ] c) Binomial
>> - [ ] d) Uniform
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- c) Binomial
>>
>>**Explanation:** The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. This is exactly what the question is asking for.

>[!math]- Question 2
>>[!faq]- In a Bernoulli distribution, how many possible outcomes are there?
>> - [ ] a) 1
>> - [ ] b) 2
>> - [ ] c) 3
>> - [ ] d) 4
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) 2
>>
>>**Explanation:** The Bernoulli distribution describes an experiment with only two possible outcomes, typically called "success" and "failure".

>[!math]- Question 3
>>[!faq]- What is the mean of a Poisson distribution with parameter λ?
>> - [ ] a) λ
>> - [ ] b) λ^2
>> - [ ] c) √λ
>> - [ ] d) 1/λ
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- a) λ
>>
>>**Explanation:** In a Poisson distribution, the mean is equal to the parameter λ. This is one of the key properties of the Poisson distribution.

>[!math]- Question 4
>>[!faq]- Which distribution would you use to model the number of coin flips needed to get the first head?
>> - [ ] a) Binomial
>> - [ ] b) Geometric
>> - [ ] c) Hypergeometric
>> - [ ] d) Uniform
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) Geometric
>>
>>**Explanation:** The geometric distribution models the number of trials until the first success occurs. In this case, we're looking at the number of coin flips (trials) until we get the first head (success).

>[!math]- Question 5
>>[!faq]- In a discrete uniform distribution with n possible outcomes, what is the probability of each outcome?
>> - [ ] a) 1/2
>> - [ ] b) 1/n
>> - [ ] c) n
>> - [ ] d) n-1
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) 1/n
>>
>>**Explanation:** In a discrete uniform distribution, all outcomes have an equal probability. Since there are n possible outcomes, and the probabilities must sum to 1, each outcome has a probability of 1/n.

>[!math]- Question 6
>>[!faq]- The variance of a binomial distribution with parameters n and θ is:
>> - [ ] a) nθ
>> - [ ] b) nθ(1-θ)
>> - [ ] c) √(nθ(1-θ))
>> - [ ] d) nθ^2
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) nθ(1-θ)
>>
>>**Explanation:** The variance of a binomial distribution is given by the formula nθ(1-θ), where n is the number of trials and θ is the probability of success on each trial.

>[!math]- Question 7
>>[!faq]- Which distribution would you use to model the number of defective items in a batch of 100, if you know there are 5 defective items in total?
>> - [ ] a) Binomial
>> - [ ] b) Poisson
>> - [ ] c) Hypergeometric
>> - [ ] d) Negative Binomial
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- c) Hypergeometric
>>
>>**Explanation:** The hypergeometric distribution is used when sampling without replacement from a finite population. In this case, we're selecting from a finite batch (100 items) where we know the exact number of defectives (5), which fits the hypergeometric scenario.

>[!math]- Question 8
>>[!faq]- In a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are:
>> - [ ] a) Always different
>> - [ ] b) Always the same
>> - [ ] c) Sometimes the same, sometimes different
>> - [ ] d) Not related
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) Always the same
>>
>>**Explanation:** One of the key properties of the Poisson distribution is that its mean and variance are always equal to the parameter λ.

>[!math]- Question 9
>>[!faq]- The negative binomial distribution is a generalization of which other distribution?
>> - [ ] a) Poisson
>> - [ ] b) Binomial
>> - [ ] c) Geometric
>> - [ ] d) Uniform
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- c) Geometric
>>
>>**Explanation:** The geometric distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution where we're interested in the number of trials until the first success. The negative binomial generalizes this to the number of trials until the r-th success.

>[!math]- Question 10
>>[!faq]- Which distribution would you use to model the number of customers arriving at a store in one hour?
>> - [ ] a) Binomial
>> - [ ] b) Poisson
>> - [ ] c) Geometric
>> - [ ] d) Uniform
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) Poisson
>>
>>**Explanation:** The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, making it suitable for modeling customer arrivals in a given time period.

>[!math]- Question 11
>>[!faq]- In a geometric distribution with probability of success p, what is the mean?
>> - [ ] a) p
>> - [ ] b) 1-p
>> - [ ] c) 1/p
>> - [ ] d) p^2
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- c) 1/p
>>
>>**Explanation:** The mean of a geometric distribution is 1/p, where p is the probability of success on each trial.

>[!math]- Question 12
>>[!faq]- Which of the following is NOT a parameter of the hypergeometric distribution?
>> - [ ] a) Population size (N)
>> - [ ] b) Number of success states in the population (k)
>> - [ ] c) Number of draws (n)
>> - [ ] d) Probability of success (p)
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- d) Probability of success (p)
>>
>>**Explanation:** The hypergeometric distribution is parameterized by the population size (N), number of success states (k), and number of draws (n). Unlike the binomial distribution, it doesn't use a probability of success as a parameter.

>[!math]- Question 13
>>[!faq]- The probability mass function (PMF) of which distribution includes a factorial term?
>> - [ ] a) Binomial
>> - [ ] b) Geometric
>> - [ ] c) Poisson
>> - [ ] d) Uniform
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- c) Poisson
>>
>>**Explanation:** The PMF of the Poisson distribution is f(x; λ) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!, which includes a factorial term in the denominator.

>[!math]- Question 14
>>[!faq]- In a Bernoulli distribution, if θ represents the probability of success, what is the probability of failure?
>> - [ ] a) θ
>> - [ ] b) 1-θ
>> - [ ] c) θ^2
>> - [ ] d) √θ
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) 1-θ
>>
>>**Explanation:** In a Bernoulli distribution, there are only two outcomes: success (with probability θ) and failure. Since probabilities must sum to 1, the probability of failure is 1-θ.

>[!math]- Question 15
>>[!faq]- Which distribution would you use to model the number of heads in 10 coin flips?
>> - [ ] a) Poisson
>> - [ ] b) Geometric
>> - [ ] c) Binomial
>> - [ ] d) Hypergeometric
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- c) Binomial
>>
>>**Explanation:** The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials. Coin flips are independent trials with two possible outcomes (success = heads, failure = tails), making this a perfect scenario for the binomial distribution.

>[!math]- Question 16
>>[!faq]- The variance of a Poisson distribution with parameter λ is:
>> - [ ] a) λ
>> - [ ] b) λ^2
>> - [ ] c) √λ
>> - [ ] d) 1/λ
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- a) λ
>>
>>**Explanation:** In a Poisson distribution, the variance is equal to the parameter λ. This is the same as its mean, which is a unique property of the Poisson distribution.

>[!math]- Question 17
>>[!faq]- In a negative binomial distribution, what does the parameter 'r' represent?
>> - [ ] a) Number of trials
>> - [ ] b) Number of successes
>> - [ ] c) Probability of success
>> - [ ] d) Population size
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) Number of successes
>>
>>**Explanation:** In a negative binomial distribution, 'r' represents the number of successes we're waiting for before stopping the experiment.

>[!math]- Question 18
>>[!faq]- Which distribution has only two parameters: n and θ?
>> - [ ] a) Poisson
>> - [ ] b) Binomial
>> - [ ] c) Hypergeometric
>> - [ ] d) Negative Binomial
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) Binomial
>>
>>**Explanation:** The binomial distribution is parameterized by n (number of trials) and θ (probability of success on each trial).

>[!math]- Question 19
>>[!faq]- In a hypergeometric distribution, what happens to the probability of success on each draw as you continue to draw without replacement?
>> - [ ] a) It increases
>> - [ ] b) It decreases
>> - [ ] c) It remains constant
>> - [ ] d) It fluctuates randomly
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) It decreases
>>
>>**Explanation:** In a hypergeometric distribution, we're sampling without replacement. As we draw items, the composition of the remaining population changes, typically decreasing the probability of success on subsequent draws.

>[!math]- Question 20
>>[!faq]- Which of the following distributions is NOT always symmetric?
>> - [ ] a) Binomial with θ = 0.5
>> - [ ] b) Poisson
>> - [ ] c) Discrete Uniform
>> - [ ] d) Hypergeometric
>
>>[!success]- Answer
>>- b) Poisson
>>
>>**Explanation:** The Poisson distribution is generally right-skewed, especially for small values of λ. It approaches a symmetric distribution only as λ becomes very large. The other listed distributions are symmetric under the conditions specified or in general.
