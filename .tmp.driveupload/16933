Hill Climbing is a local search optimization algorithm that iteratively improves a solution by making incremental changes. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary solution and iteratively moves to a neighboring solution that has a higher value (or lower if it's a minimization problem) based on a heuristic or evaluation function. It continues this process until it reaches a peak where no neighboring solution is better, i.e., a local optimum.

> [!summary]- Key Concepts:
> 1. **Current State**: The algorithm starts with an initial state or solution.
> 2. **Neighbors**: The possible states you can transition to from the current state.
> 3. **Evaluation Function**: Determines the quality (or cost) of a solution.
> 4. **Local Maximum/Minimum**: The algorithm can get stuck at a local maximum or minimum, where no neighboring states are better but the global optimum has not been found.
> 5. **Greedy Approach**: It only considers the best immediate neighbor.

### Python Code Example:
Let's consider a simple maximization problem where we try to maximize a function `f(x)` within a given range.

```python
import random

# Function to optimize: f(x) = -(x-3)^2 + 10, which has a maximum at x = 3
def objective_function(x):
    return -(x - 3) ** 2 + 10

# Hill climbing algorithm
def hill_climbing():
    # Initialize with a random solution
    current_solution = random.uniform(-10, 10)
    current_value = objective_function(current_solution)

    step_size = 0.1  # Step size to move in search space
    max_iterations = 100  # Limit the number of iterations

    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Generate neighboring solutions
        next_solution = current_solution + random.uniform(-step_size, step_size)
        next_value = objective_function(next_solution)

        # If the neighbor is better, move to that neighbor
        if next_value > current_value:
            current_solution, current_value = next_solution, next_value
            print(f"Iteration {iteration}: Solution = {current_solution}, Value = {current_value}")
        else:
            # If no better neighbor is found, stop (local optimum reached)
            print(f"Local maximum found at iteration {iteration}: Solution = {current_solution}, Value = {current_value}")
            break

    return current_solution, current_value

# Run the algorithm
best_solution, best_value = hill_climbing()
print(f"Best solution: {best_solution}, Best value: {best_value}")
```

> [!NOTE]- Code Explanation:
> 1. **Objective Function**: `f(x) = -(x - 3)^2 + 10` is the function we are trying to maximize. The function has a maximum at `x = 3`. This represents our problem space.
> 
> 2. **Initial Solution**: The algorithm starts with a random solution `current_solution` chosen from a uniform distribution between -10 and 10.
> 
> 3. **Hill Climbing Loop**: The algorithm runs for a maximum of 100 iterations. In each iteration:
>    - It generates a neighboring solution by adding a small random value (within the `step_size` of Â±0.1) to the current solution.
>    - It evaluates the objective function at this new point (`next_solution`) and compares it to the current solution.
>    - If the new solution is better (i.e., the value of the objective function is higher), the algorithm updates the current solution to the new one.
>    - If no better solution is found, the algorithm stops, assuming a local maximum has been reached.
> 
> 4. **Stopping Condition**: The algorithm stops if no improvement is found in a step or after `max_iterations` are completed.
> 
> 5. **Output**: The algorithm prints the best solution found and its corresponding value.

This is a simple example of hill climbing with a single variable. In more complex scenarios, the search space may involve multiple variables, and the algorithm can use different techniques to explore the neighborhood more efficiently. However, the algorithm is greedy, so it can easily get stuck at local optima, not necessarily finding the global optimum.
