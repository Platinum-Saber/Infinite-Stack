## Question 01
- A population has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 6. 
	- (a) What are the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean for N = 16?
	-  (b) What are the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean for N = 20?

> [!math]- Answer
> ### Given:
> - Population Mean ($\mu$) = 50
> - Population Standard Deviation ($\sigma$) = 6
> 
> ### a. Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution of the Mean for \(N = 16\)
> 
> 1. **Mean of the Sampling Distribution**:
>    The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean is the same as the population mean:
>    $$
>    \mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu = 50
>    $$
> 
> 2. **Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution (Standard Error)**:
>    The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (also called the standard error) is given by:
>    $$
>    \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{16}} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5

> ### Summary for \(N = 16\):
> - Mean: **50**
> - Standard Deviation: **1.5**

> 
> 1. **Mean of the Sampling Distribution**:
>    The mean remains the same:

>    \mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu = 50

> 2. **Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution (Standard Error)**:

>    \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{20}} \approx \frac{6}{4.472} \approx 1.342
