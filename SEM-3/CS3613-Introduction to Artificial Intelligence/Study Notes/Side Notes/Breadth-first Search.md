Breadth-First Search (BFS) is one of the simplest and most fundamental **uninformed search algorithms**. BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, where all edges have the same cost.

### Key Characteristics of BFS:

1. **Level-wise Expansion**: BFS explores nodes level by level. Starting from the root (or any initial node), it explores all its neighbors, then moves on to their neighbors.
2. **Queue-Based**: BFS uses a **queue** (FIFO) to keep track of the order of node exploration.
3. **Complete and Optimal**: BFS is **complete** (it always finds a solution if one exists) and **optimal** when all edges have the same cost (unweighted graph).
4. **Uninformed**: Like UCS, BFS does not know anything about the goal's location and explores uniformly.

### How BFS Works:

1. BFS starts at a given node and explores all its neighbors first.
2. Nodes are placed in a queue, and at each step, BFS dequeues a node, processes it, and enqueues all its unvisited neighbors.
3. The process continues until the queue is empty or the goal is found.

> > 1. **Queue (FIFO)**: The BFS algorithm uses a `deque` (double-ended queue) from Pythonâ€™s `collections` module. Each element in the queue is a tuple containing the current node and the path to that node.

### Key Points:

- **Queue Expansion**: BFS expands nodes in the order they were discovered, ensuring that nodes closer to the start are expanded first.
- **Shortest Path Guarantee**: In an unweighted graph, BFS guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges (as in the example).
- **FIFO Queue**: The queue is central to BFS's level-wise expansion.

### Advantages of BFS:

- **Complete**: BFS will always find a solution if one exists.
- **Optimal for Unweighted Graphs**: BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **Simple**: BFS is easy to implement and works well for simple graphs.

### Disadvantages:

- **Memory-Intensive**: BFS can use a lot of memory, as it stores all nodes at the current level in the queue before moving to the next level.
- **Slower for Large Graphs**: For graphs with many nodes, BFS may explore many nodes before finding the goal, making it slower.
