# Agents
> [!info] Agent types
> - **Problem solving agent** : Execute a given solution and are typically not well-suited for dynamic problems.
> - **Knowledge based/ Planning agents** 

<br>

## Knowledge Based Agents
> [!note] Characteristics
> - Given explicit goals.
> - Can achieve competence quickly by being told or learning
> - Adapts to changes in environment.


> [!summary] Functionality
> - Maintains a representation of the world.
> - Infer new representations of the world.
> - Use the representation to decide what to do.

<br>

### Knowledge Representations
- **Atomic** : The state is considered as a whole with no internal structure available to the agent.
- **Factored** : Involves the assignment of values to variables.
- **Structured** : Involves objects and relations, representing facts about these relations.

<br>

### Knowledge Base (KB)
- The place where the agent's world representation **world representation** is maintained.
- It consists of a set of *sentences* written in a *knowledge representation language*, also known as **axioms**.
- KB is crucial for,
	- Adding new information (TELL)
	- Retrieving information (ASK)
- Both involve inference. (derive new info from old)

<br>
<br>

# Logic
- Fundamental concepts of logical representation & reasoning.

### Logical Languages
- A knowledge base contains **sentences** that must be **syntactically** *correct*. The **semantics** of these sentences define their truth in possible worlds (models).

> [!info]- Semantics
> - Defines the truth of sentences with respect to each possible world.
> - Possible world = model; An abstraction where each sentence is either true or false.
> - If a sentence `S` is true in model `m`. This implies that `m` satisfies `s` or `m` is a model of `s`.
> - Set of `m` which are models of `s` is defined as : `M(s)`

<br>

### Logical Reasoning
- Involves **logical entailment**, where one **sentence** *implies* another if it is true in every **model** where the first sentence is true. **Logical inference** allows the agent to derive conclusions from its knowledge base.

> [!info]- Logical Inference
> - Derive conclusions using **entailments**.
> - **Model checking** : enumerates all possible models to check that a sentence is true in all models where the `KB` is true.
> - `i` - Inference algorithm, should be *sound*, *truth preserving*, and *complete*.
> - Model checking works if space for models is finite.

<br>

### Grounding
- if `KB` is true in the real world, then any sentence derived from `KB` by a **sound inference** procedure is also true in the real world.

# The Wumpus World

- The Wumpus World is a classic example used to illustrate logical agents in AI. It is characterized by properties such as partial observability, determinism, sequential nature, and a single agent environment. The agent must navigate the world based on its percepts (e.g., stench, breeze, glitter) and use logical reasoning to make decisions.

<br>

### Properties of the Wumpus World 
- **Partially observable**: The Wumpus world in AI is partially observable because the agent can only sense the immediate surroundings, such as an adjacent room. 
- **Deterministic**: It is deterministic because the result and end of the world are already known. 
- **Sequential**: It is sequential because the order is essential. 
- **Static**: It is motionless because Wumpus and Pits are not moving. 
- **Discrete**: The surroundings are distinct. 
- **One agent**: The environment is a single agent because we only have one agent, and Wumpus is not regarded as an agent.
