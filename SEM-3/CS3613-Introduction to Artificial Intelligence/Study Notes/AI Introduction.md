### Acting humanly (The Turing test approach)

>[!faq]-  What is 'Turing test' 
>
A method to evaluate the intelligence of a machine.
If a series of questions are answered by a human and a machine, when the interrogator can not distinguish between the responses, the machine is said to be intelligent. 

>[!error]- Drawbacks of the test
>- Doesn't really indicate if the machine has intelligence.
>- Mimicking human behavior doesn't make machines intelligence.
>- Human intelligence isn't the only form of intelligence.

>[!example]- Major components of AI
>- Natural language processing (to communicate)
>- Knowledge representation (to store what it learns)
>- Automated reasoning (to answer Qs & draw new conclusions)
>- Machine learning (to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns)
>- Computer vision (to perceive the world)
>- Robotics (for mobility)

### Thinking humanly (The cognitive modeling approach)

>[!FAQ]- What is Thinking humanly 
>Machines that think like humans.
>For this a sufficiently precise theory of how the mind works is required.

>[!info]- Possible ways to achieve this is by
>- Introspection - catch your own thoughts as they go by
>- Psychological experiments - observe a person in action
>- brain imaging - observing the brain activity
>
>Then if the program's IO behavior matches corresponding human behavior it can be said that the machine thinks like a human.

### Thinking Rationally (The "Law of Thought" approach)
>[!FAQ]- What is rational thinking
>Ideal or correct way of reasoning or thinking.

>[!error]- Drawbacks of this approach
> - Difficult to take informal knowledge and express it in a formal logical terms
> - Computationally intensive (Even a problem with a few dozen facts can exhaust any computer unless itâ€™s guided as to which reasoning steps to try first.)

### Acting Rationally (The rational agent approach)
>[!FAQ]- What is an Agent 
>An entity that perceives and acts.

>[!abstract]- Computer agents are expected to
>- Operate autonomously
>- Perceive their environment
>- Persist over a prolonged time period
>- adapt to change
>- Create and pursue goals 

<br>

>[!FAQ]- What is a ***Rational agent*** ?
>An entity that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or when there is uncertainty, the best-expected outcome. 

>[!summary]-  Qualities of rational agents
>-logical reasoning is one way of acting rationally (but there are other ways)
>- Can be different from Acting human, because humans aren't always rational/logical.
>- All the skills needed for the "Turing test" also allows an agent to act rationally. 
>- AI has focused on the study and construction of agents that do the **right thing.**
>- What counts as the **right thing** is defined by the objective that we provide to the agent.

>[!tip]- Advantages of *rational agents*
>- More general than the "law of thought" approach
>- More amendable to scientific development

>[!note]- Limited rationality 
>The perfect rationality is not feasible in complex environments. The computational demands are too high.
>Hence partial rationality is used for ease of implementation

#### Foundations of AI
>[!check]-  philosophy 
>-Logic, methods of reasoning, mind as physical system foundations of learning, language, rationality

>[!check]- Mathematics
>- Formal representation and proof algorithms, computation, (un)decidability, (in)tractability, probability

>[!check]- Economics
>- Utility, decision theory
 
 >[!check]- Neuroscience
>- Study of the nervous system, particularly, the brain

 >[!check]- Psychology
>- Study how humans and animals think

>[!check]- Computer engineering
>- Building fast computers

 >[!check]- Control theory
>- Design systems that maximize an objective function over time

 >[!check]- Linguistics
>- Knowledge representation, grammar
