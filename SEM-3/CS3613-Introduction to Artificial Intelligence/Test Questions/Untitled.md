>> - [ ] d) $P \Leftrightarrow Q$ from $P \land Q$

>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- b) $Q$ from $P \Rightarrow Q$ and $P$
>>
>>**Explanation:** Modus Ponens states that if $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true and $P$ is true, then $Q$ must be true.

---

>[!math]- **Question 9**
>>[!faq]- Which of the following formulas is NOT in CNF?
>> - [ ] a) $(P \lor Q) \land (\neg R \lor S)$
>> - [ ] b) $(P \land Q) \lor R$

>> - [ ] d) $\neg P \lor Q$

>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- b) $(P \land Q) \lor R$
>>
>>**Explanation:** In CNF, $\land$ cannot appear inside disjunctions, so $(P \land Q) \lor R$ is not CNF.

---

>[!math]- **Question 10**
>>[!faq]- If $P = \text{True}$ and $Q = \text{False}$, what is the truth value of $P \Rightarrow Q$?
>> - [ ] a) True
>> - [ ] b) False
>> - [ ] c) Cannot be determined
>> - [ ] d) None of the above

>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- b) False
>>
>>**Explanation:** The implication $P \Rightarrow Q$ is false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.

---

>> - [ ] a) Eliminate biconditionals

>> - [ ] c) Apply De Morgan’s laws
>> - [ ] d) Distribute $\land$ over $\lor$

>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- d) Distribute $\land$ over $\lor$
>>

>> - [ ] a) $(P \Rightarrow Q) \land (Q \Rightarrow P)$

>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- a) $(P \Rightarrow Q) \land (Q \Rightarrow P)$
>>
>>**Explanation:** The biconditional is true if both directions of implication hold.

---

>[!math]- **Question 17**
>>[!faq]- Which of the following is **true** about a **valid** sentence?
>> - [ ] a) It is true in some models
>> - [ ] b) It is true in all models
>> - [ ] c) It is false in all models
>> - [ ] d) It is neither true nor false
>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- b) It is true in all models

>>**Explanation:** A valid sentence is always true, regardless of the model.

---

>[!math]- **Question 18**
>>[!faq]- The resolution rule applies only to:
>> - [ ] a) Conjunctions of literals
>> - [ ] b) Disjunctions of literals
>> - [ ] c) Biconditional sentences
>> - [ ] d) Implications
>
>
>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- b) Disjunctions of literals
>>
>>**Explanation:** The resolution rule operates on disjunctions in CNF.

---

>[!math]- **Question 19**
>>[!faq]- What is the **truth value** of $(P \lor \neg P)$ in any model?
>> - [ ] a) True
>> - [ ] b) False
>> - [ ] c) True in some models, false in others
>> - [ ] d) Cannot be determined
>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- a) True
>>
>>**Explanation:** $(P \lor \neg P)$ is a tautology and is true in all models.

---

>[!math]- **Question 20**
>>[!faq]- Which of the following steps is **required** to convert a formula to CNF?
>> - [ ] a) Convert to Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)
>> - [ ] b) Apply De Morgan’s law
>> - [ ] c) Convert all conjunctions to implications
>> - [ ] d) Negate all literals

>>[!success]- **Answer**
>>- b) Apply De Morgan’s law

>>**Explanation:** De Morgan's law helps distribute negations in the formula to bring it to CNF.
