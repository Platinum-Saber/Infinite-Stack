# Chapter 9: Main Memory

## Objectives
- Provide a detailed description of various ways to organize memory hardware.
- Discuss various memory-management techniques.
- Describe the Intel Pentium architecture, which supports both pure segmentation and segmentation with paging.

## Background
- **Program Execution**: For a program to run, it must be loaded from disk into memory and allocated to a process.
- **Access**: Main memory and registers are the only storage units that the CPU can directly access. The memory unit interacts with the CPU through:
  - A stream of addresses with read requests.
  - A stream of addresses with data and write requests.
- **Access Times**:
  - Register access occurs in one CPU clock cycle or less.
  - Accessing main memory can take multiple cycles, which may lead to stalls in CPU performance.
- **Cache Memory**: A cache is utilized between the main memory and CPU registers to speed up access times.

## Memory Protection
- **Need for Protection**: It is crucial to ensure that a process can only access memory addresses within its designated address space.
- **Implementation of Protection**:
  - Protection is enforced using a pair of registers: the base register and the limit register. These define the logical address space for a process.
  
## Hardware Address Protection
- **Memory Access Checks**: The CPU must verify that every memory access generated in user mode is within the bounds specified by the base and limit registers for that user.
- **Privileged Instructions**: The instructions used to load the base and limit registers are considered privileged, meaning they can only be executed by the operating system or in a secure context.

### Summary Points
- Memory management is essential for efficient CPU operation and program execution.
- The architecture of memory systems, including the use of caches and protection mechanisms, plays a critical role in system performance and security.
- Understanding the relationship between memory management techniques and hardware architecture is fundamental for optimizing system operations.

# Address Binding and Memory Management

## Overview
Address binding is a crucial concept in operating systems that determines how program addresses are mapped to physical memory locations. This section discusses different stages of address binding, the distinction between logical and physical address spaces, and the implications for memory management.

## Address Binding

### Input Queue
- Programs reside on disk and are queued for loading into memory for execution.
- Without address binding support, programs must be loaded at the physical address 0000, which is not practical for multiple processes.

### Address Representation
- Addresses are represented in various forms during different stages of a program's lifecycle:
  - **Source Code Addresses**: Typically symbolic, not tied to specific memory locations.
  - **Compiled Code Addresses**: Bind to relocatable addresses (e.g., “14 bytes from the beginning of this module”).
  - **Absolute Addresses**: Assigned by the linker or loader, mapping relocatable addresses to physical memory addresses (e.g., 74014).

### Binding Stages
Address binding occurs at three distinct stages:
1. **Compile Time**:
   - If the memory location is known beforehand, absolute code can be generated.
   - Requires recompilation if the starting location changes.
  
2. **Load Time**:
   - Generates relocatable code if the memory location is unknown at compile time.
  
3. **Execution Time**:
   - Binding is deferred until runtime, allowing processes to move between memory segments.
   - Requires hardware support, such as base and limit registers, to manage address maps.

## Logical vs. Physical Address Space

### Definitions
- **Logical Address**: Generated by the CPU and also known as a virtual address; represents an abstract address space that the program uses.
- **Physical Address**: The actual address seen by the memory unit (RAM).

### Address Binding Schemes
- In compile-time and load-time address-binding schemes, logical and physical addresses are identical.
- The distinction becomes significant during execution time, where logical addresses can be mapped to different physical addresses based on the process's current memory allocation.

## Key Points
- Address binding is essential for effective memory management and allows for flexibility in program execution.
- Understanding the difference between logical and physical addresses helps in grasping how operating systems manage memory allocation and process execution.
- Hardware support is necessary for efficient address mapping during execution time.

This section lays the groundwork for understanding how operating systems handle memory management through various binding techniques and the importance of logical versus physical addressing.

# Memory Management Concepts

## Address Binding
- **Logical Address Space**: This refers to the set of all logical addresses generated by a program during its execution.
- **Physical Address Space**: This is the set of all physical addresses generated by a program.

## Memory-Management Unit (MMU)
- The MMU is a critical hardware component responsible for mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses at runtime.
- Various methods can be employed for this mapping, which will be discussed in further detail throughout the chapter.

### Execution-Time Address Binding
- **Relocation Register**: 
  - In a simple address mapping scheme, the base register is referred to as the relocation register.
  - The value stored in the relocation register is added to every logical address generated by a user process before it is sent to memory.
  - This means the user program operates with logical addresses and does not have direct access to physical addresses.

### Key Concepts
- **Execution-Time Binding**: This occurs when a reference is made to a location in memory, binding logical addresses to physical addresses dynamically as the program runs.

## Dynamic Loading
- **Definition**: Dynamic loading means that not all parts of a program need to be loaded into memory at once for execution.
- **Mechanism**: 
  - A routine is only loaded when it is explicitly called during program execution.
  - This approach enhances memory-space utilization since routines that are not used are never loaded into memory.
- **Storage**: All routines are stored on disk in a relocatable load format.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Particularly useful when dealing with large codebases that include infrequently used cases.
  - Does not require special support from the operating system; instead, it is implemented through program design.
  
### Example of Dynamic Loading
- A program may include various functions, but only the functions that are invoked during execution will be loaded into memory, thus conserving memory resources.

## Summary
Understanding the concepts of logical and physical address spaces, the role of the MMU, and the implications of dynamic loading is essential for effective memory management in operating systems. These principles help optimize memory usage and improve program execution efficiency.

## Dynamic Linking

### Definition
- **Dynamic Linking**: A method where linking of libraries and program code is postponed until the program is executed, as opposed to static linking where the linking occurs at compile time.

### Key Concepts
- **Static Linking**: Combines system libraries and program code into a single binary image at load time.
- **Stub**: A small piece of code that helps locate the appropriate memory-resident library routine. The stub replaces itself with the address of the routine and executes it.
- **Memory Check**: The operating system checks if the required routine is in the process's memory address. If not, it adds it to the address space.
- **Shared Libraries**: Another term for dynamic linking, which allows multiple programs to share the same library code in memory.
- **Patching System Libraries**: Dynamic linking is particularly useful for updating libraries without needing to recompile programs, although versioning may be necessary to ensure compatibility.

## Contiguous Allocation

### Definition
- **Contiguous Allocation**: An early method of memory management where main memory is divided into contiguous sections to allocate space for the operating system and user processes.

### Key Concepts
- Main memory is typically divided into two partitions:
  - **Resident Operating System**: Usually located in low memory, containing the interrupt vector.
  - **User Processes**: Located in high memory, each process occupies a single contiguous section of memory.

### Memory Protection
- **Relocation Registers**: Used to protect user processes from one another and from altering the operating system's code and data.
  - **Base Register**: Contains the smallest physical address.
  - **Limit Register**: Specifies the range of logical addresses; each logical address must be less than the limit register value.
- **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: Maps logical addresses dynamically, allowing for flexibility such as transient kernel code and variable kernel size.

### Hardware Support
- The hardware must support relocation and limit registers to ensure efficient memory management and protection among processes.

| MMU                      | Maps logical addresses to physical addresses dynamically.                                       |

# Variable Partition and Dynamic Storage Allocation

## Variable Partition Allocation
- **Multiple-partition allocation**: This method allows for a degree of multiprogramming, which is limited by the number of available memory partitions.
- **Variable-partition sizes**: Partitions are sized according to the specific needs of the processes, enhancing memory efficiency.
- **Holes**: These are blocks of available memory scattered throughout. When a process requires memory, it is allocated from a hole that is large enough to accommodate it.
- **Memory management**: When a process exits, its allocated partition is freed, and adjacent free partitions are combined to form larger holes.
- **Operating System's role**: The OS keeps track of:
  - a) Allocated partitions
  - b) Free partitions (holes)

## Dynamic Storage-Allocation Problem
- **Allocation strategies**:
  - **First-fit**: Allocates the first hole that is large enough to meet the request.
  - **Best-fit**: Allocates the smallest hole that is adequate, which requires searching the entire list unless the holes are ordered by size. This method aims to minimize leftover space.
  - **Worst-fit**: Allocates the largest hole available, also necessitating a full list search. This strategy tends to create the largest leftover holes.
  
- **Efficiency**: First-fit and best-fit strategies are generally preferred over worst-fit due to better speed and storage utilization.

## Fragmentation
- **Types of Fragmentation**:
  - **External Fragmentation**: Occurs when there is enough total memory to satisfy a request, but it is not contiguous.
  - **Internal Fragmentation**: Happens when allocated memory is slightly larger than what was requested, leading to unused memory within a partition.

- **Fragmentation Analysis**: Research indicates that with $N$ blocks allocated, approximately $0.5N$ blocks may be lost to fragmentation, with about one-third potentially being unusable. This is referred to as the **50-percent rule**.

## Reducing Fragmentation
- **Compaction**: This technique aims to reduce external fragmentation by rearranging memory contents to consolidate free memory into a single large block. 
  - **Requirements for Compaction**: It is only feasible if relocation is dynamic, meaning that processes can be moved in memory while they are running.

This summary encapsulates the key concepts related to variable partition allocation, dynamic storage allocation strategies, and fragmentation in memory management, essential for understanding operating system memory management techniques.


# Paging and Address Translation in Operating Systems

## Key Concepts

### I/O Problem
- **Latch Job in Memory**: While a job is performing Input/Output (I/O) operations, it is kept in memory.
- **I/O into OS Buffers**: I/O operations are conducted only into Operating System (OS) buffers.
- **Fragmentation**: The backing store may also experience fragmentation issues similar to those in physical memory.

### Paging
- **Definition**: Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Avoids External Fragmentation**: Memory can be allocated in noncontiguous blocks.
  - **Handles Varying Sized Memory Chunks**: Fixed-size memory blocks simplify allocation.
  
#### Memory Division
- **Physical Memory**: Divided into fixed-sized blocks known as **frames**. Frame sizes are typically powers of 2, ranging from 512 bytes to 16 MB.
- **Logical Memory**: Divided into blocks of the same size called **pages**.

### Page Table
- **Function**: Keeps track of all free frames and maps logical addresses to physical addresses.
- **Loading a Program**: To run a program requiring N pages, the system must locate N free frames and load the program into those frames.

### Address Translation Scheme
- **Logical Address Structure**:
  - **Page Number (p)**: Serves as an index into the page table, which holds the base address of each page in physical memory.
  - **Page Offset (d)**: Added to the base address to produce the physical memory address.
  
- **Logical Address Formula**:
  - For a logical address space of size $2^m$ and page size $2^n$:
    - Logical Address = (Page Number, Page Offset) = $(p, d)$
    - Where:
      - $p = m - n$ (number of bits for the page number)
      - $d = n$ (number of bits for the page offset)

### Internal Fragmentation
- **Definition**: Internal fragmentation occurs when allocated memory blocks (frames) are larger than the data they contain, leading to wasted space within those blocks.

## Example of Paging
- **Scenario**: Consider a logical address space where $n = 2$ (page size of 4 bytes) and $m = 4$ (physical memory of 32 bytes, consisting of 8 pages).
- **Calculation of Internal Fragmentation**: This would involve analyzing how much space within each frame is wasted due to internal fragmentation.

### Visual Representation
- Diagrams of the paging model illustrate the relationship between logical and physical memory, showcasing how pages map to frames.



# Memory Management and Page Tables

## Key Concepts

### Page Size and Fragmentation
- **Page Size**: 2,048 bytes
- **Process Size**: 72,766 bytes
- **Pages Required**: 35 pages + 1,086 bytes
- **Internal Fragmentation**: Calculated as the difference between page size and the actual data used:
  $$
  \text{Internal Fragmentation} = 2,048 - 1,086 = 962 \text{ bytes}
  $$
- **Worst Case Fragmentation**: 1 frame – 1 byte.
- **Average Fragmentation**: 
  $$
  \text{Average Fragmentation} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ frame size}
  $$
- The question arises whether smaller frame sizes are desirable, considering that smaller frames may lead to increased fragmentation.

### Page Table Management
- **Page Table Location**: The page table is stored in main memory.
- **Registers**:
  - **Page-table Base Register (PTBR)**: Points to the page table in memory.
  - **Page-table Length Register (PTLR)**: Indicates the size of the page table.
- **Memory Access**: Accessing data/instructions requires two memory accesses:
  1. One access for the page table.
  2. One access for the actual data/instruction.

### Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs)
- **Purpose**: TLBs are used to address the two-memory access problem by caching recent translations.
- **Functionality**:
  - TLBs may store **Address-Space Identifiers (ASIDs)** to uniquely identify processes, which helps in providing address-space protection.
  - TLBs typically contain 64 to 1,024 entries.
- **TLB Miss Handling**: When a TLB miss occurs, the required value is loaded into the TLB for faster future access.
- **Replacement Policies**: Must be considered for managing entries in the TLB, which can include:
  - Wires down some entries for permanent fast access.

### Hardware Considerations
- **Associative Memory**: Utilizes parallel search capabilities to expedite address translation.
- **Address Translation Process**:
  - Given a logical address (p, d):
    - If \( p \) (the page number) is found in the associative memory, the corresponding frame number is retrieved directly.
    - If not, the frame number must be retrieved from the page table in memory.

## Summary Table: Key Terms and Concepts

| Associative Memory       | Memory that allows for parallel searching for address translation           |

This summary encapsulates the critical elements of memory management concerning page tables and TLBs, essential for understanding operating systems' handling of memory and fragmentation issues.

# Paging Hardware with TLB

## Effective Access Time (EAT)

- **Hit Ratio**: The hit ratio is defined as the percentage of times a page number is successfully found in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). 
  - **Example**: A hit ratio of 80% indicates that the desired page number is found in the TLB 80% of the time.

- **Memory Access Times**:
  - When a page is found in the TLB, accessing memory takes 10 nanoseconds (ns).
  - If the page is not found, two memory accesses are required, totaling 20 ns.

- **Calculating Effective Access Time (EAT)**:
  - The formula for EAT is given by:
    $$
    \text{EAT} = (\text{Hit Ratio} \times \text{Time if Hit}) + (\text{Miss Ratio} \times \text{Time if Miss})
    $$
  - For an 80% hit ratio:
    $$
    \text{EAT} = 0.80 \times 10 \text{ ns} + 0.20 \times 20 \text{ ns} = 12 \text{ ns}
    $$
    - This indicates a 20% slowdown in access time compared to ideal conditions.

  - For a more favorable hit ratio of 99%:
    $$
    \text{EAT} = 0.99 \times 10 \text{ ns} + 0.01 \times 20 \text{ ns} = 10.1 \text{ ns}
    $$
    - This results in only a 1% slowdown in access time.

## Memory Protection

- **Protection Bits**: Each frame in memory can have an associated protection bit indicating the type of access permitted (read-only or read-write). Additional bits may indicate execute-only access.

- **Valid-Invalid Bit**: Each entry in the page table includes a valid-invalid bit:
  - **Valid (v)**: Indicates that the associated page is part of the process's logical address space and is legal.
  - **Invalid (i)**: Indicates that the page is not part of the process's logical address space.
  
- **Page-Table Length Register (PTLR)**: An alternative to using valid-invalid bits, the PTLR can also manage the validity of page entries.

- **Violation Handling**: Any access violations result in a trap to the kernel, which handles the error.

## Shared Pages

- **Shared Code**: 
  - One copy of read-only (reentrant) code can be shared among multiple processes, such as text editors, compilers, and window systems. 
  - This is akin to multiple threads sharing the same process space.
  - Shared pages can facilitate interprocess communication, especially if sharing of read-write pages is permitted.

- **Private Code and Data**: Each process has its own private code and data, which are not shared with other processes.

This chunk emphasizes the importance of effective memory management through TLB efficiency, memory protection mechanisms, and the advantages of shared versus private memory in process management.

## Memory Management in Operating Systems

### Private and Shared Pages
- Each process maintains a separate copy of its code and data.
- Private code and data pages can be located anywhere within the logical address space.

### Page Table Structure
- Paging memory structures can become extensive when using straightforward methods.
- Example: In a 32-bit logical address space with a page size of 4 KB ($2^{12}$ bytes).
  - The total number of pages = $2^{32} / 2^{12} = 2^{20}$, resulting in 1 million entries.
  - If each page table entry is 4 bytes, then each process requires 4 MB of physical address space for the page table alone.
- Allocating this space contiguously in main memory is impractical.

### Solutions for Page Table Management
To manage large page tables, several techniques can be employed:
1. **Hierarchical Paging**
2. **Hashed Page Tables**
3. **Inverted Page Tables**

## Hierarchical Page Tables
- This technique involves breaking the logical address space into multiple page tables.
- A common method is the **two-level page table**.

### Two-Level Paging Example
- In a 32-bit machine with a 4 KB page size, a logical address is divided into:
  - **Page Number**: 20 bits
  - **Page Offset**: 12 bits
- The page number can be further divided:
  - **Outer Page Table**: 10 bits
  - **Inner Page Table**: 10 bits
- This results in a logical address structure where:
  - $p_1$ is the index into the outer page table.
  - $p_2$ is the displacement within the page of the inner page table.
- This configuration is known as a **forward-mapped page table**.

### Address-Translation Scheme
- The address-translation scheme needs to accommodate the hierarchical structure of page tables for efficient memory management.

## Limitations of Two-Level Paging
- As systems evolve, even a two-level paging scheme may not be sufficient for a 64-bit logical address space, indicating the need for more advanced paging techniques to handle larger address spaces efficiently.

# Memory Management Techniques

## Paging in Operating Systems

### Page Table Structure
- **Page Size**: When the page size is 4 KB ($2^{12}$ bytes), the page table can contain $2^{52}$ entries.
- **Two-Level Paging Scheme**:
  - Inner page tables can hold $2^{10}$ entries, each 4 bytes in size.
  - The outer page table consists of $2^{42}$ entries, equating to $2^{44}$ bytes.
  - A proposed solution to manage the size of the outer page table is to add a second outer page table, although this can still result in a size of $2^{34}$ bytes.
  - This structure may require up to four memory accesses to retrieve a single physical memory location.

### Three-Level Paging Scheme
- A three-level paging scheme is an extension of the two-level scheme, further organizing the page tables to reduce the memory overhead associated with large address spaces.

## Hashed Page Tables
- **Application**: Commonly used in address spaces greater than 32 bits.
- **Mechanism**:
  - The virtual page number is hashed into a page table.
  - Each entry in this page table contains a chain of elements that hash to the same location.
  - Each element includes:
    1. The virtual page number.
    2. The value of the mapped page frame.
    3. A pointer to the next element in the chain.
- **Search Process**: 
  - Virtual page numbers are compared in the chain until a match is found, allowing for the extraction of the corresponding physical frame.
- **Clustered Page Tables**: 
  - A variation for 64-bit addresses where each entry refers to multiple pages (e.g., 16 pages).
  - Particularly beneficial for sparse address spaces, where memory references are non-contiguous and scattered.

### Inverted Page Tables
- **Concept**: Instead of each process maintaining its own page table, an inverted page table tracks all physical pages in memory.
- **Structure**:
  - There is one entry for each physical page, containing:
    - The virtual address of the page stored in that physical memory location.
    - Information about the process that owns that page.
- **Advantages and Disadvantages**:
  - **Advantages**: Reduces the memory required to store page tables.
  - **Disadvantages**: Increases the time needed to search the table when a page reference occurs.


# Memory Management Concepts

## Key Concepts

### Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
- The TLB is a cache used to accelerate memory access by storing the most recently accessed translation table entries (TTEs).
- It limits the search for page-table entries to one or a few, significantly speeding up the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses.

### Shared Memory Implementation
- Shared memory in operating systems allows multiple processes to access the same physical memory.
- This is achieved by mapping a virtual address to a shared physical address, allowing efficient inter-process communication.

## Inverted Page Table Architecture

### Overview
- In modern 64-bit operating systems, such as Oracle SPARC Solaris, the inverted page table architecture is utilized for efficiency and low overhead.
- This architecture employs a more complex hashing mechanism to manage memory addresses.

### Structure
- **Two Hash Tables**: 
  - One for the kernel.
  - One for all user processes.
- Each hash table maps virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses.

### Entry Design
- Each entry in the hash table represents a contiguous area of mapped virtual memory, making it more efficient than maintaining separate entries for each page.
- Each entry contains:
  - **Base Address**: The starting physical address.
  - **Span**: The number of pages represented by the entry.

## TLB Functionality

### TLB and Translation Storage Buffer (TSB)
- The TLB holds TTEs for fast hardware lookups.
- A cache of TTEs is maintained in a Translation Storage Buffer (TSB), which includes entries for recently accessed pages.

### Address Translation Process
1. When a virtual address is referenced, the system first searches the TLB.
2. If there is a TLB miss (the entry is not found):
   - The hardware searches the in-memory TSB for the corresponding TTE.
   - If a match is found, the TSB entry is copied into the TLB, completing the translation.
   - If no match is found, the kernel is interrupted to search the hash table.
3. The kernel creates a TTE from the appropriate hash table and stores it in the TSB.
4. Control returns to the Memory Management Unit (MMU), which completes the address translation.

## Swapping

### Definition
- Swapping is a memory management technique where a process can be temporarily moved out of physical memory to a backing store (e.g., disk storage) and later brought back into memory for continued execution.
- This allows for efficient use of limited physical memory resources.

### Implications
- Swapping can help manage memory more effectively, especially when physical memory is fully utilized, but it may introduce latency due to the time taken to read from and write to the backing store.

## Conclusion
This section highlights the critical components of memory management in modern operating systems, focusing on the TLB, inverted page table architecture, and swapping mechanisms to optimize memory access and utilization.

# Swapping in Operating Systems

## Key Concepts

### Memory Management
- **Processes and Memory**: The number of processes can exceed the available physical memory, necessitating a method to manage this overflow.
- **Backing Store**: A fast disk that is large enough to hold copies of all memory images for all users. It must provide direct access to these images to facilitate efficient process management.

### Swapping Mechanism
- **Roll Out, Roll In**: A variant of swapping used in priority-based scheduling algorithms. In this method, a lower-priority process is swapped out to allow a higher-priority process to be loaded and executed.

### Swap Time Considerations
- **Transfer Time**: The major part of the swap time is the transfer time, which is directly proportional to the amount of memory being swapped. Efficient memory management is crucial to minimize this time.
- **Ready Queue**: The operating system maintains a ready queue of processes that are ready to run and have their memory images stored on disk.

### Address Binding and I/O
- **Address Binding**: Whether a swapped-out process needs to return to the same physical addresses depends on the address binding method in use.
- **Pending I/O**: Considerations for pending input/output operations to and from the process's memory space are essential during the swapping process.

### Modified Swapping Techniques
- Many systems (e.g., UNIX, Linux, Windows) implement modified versions of swapping:
  - **Swapping Disabled**: Typically disabled until the memory allocation exceeds a defined threshold.
  - **Re-enabling**: Swapping is re-enabled once the memory demand drops below the threshold.

## Context Switch Time Including Swapping
- **Context Switch**: When a process is not in memory, the system must swap out a process and swap in the target process, which can significantly increase context switch time.
- **Example Calculation**:
  - For a 100MB process swapping to a hard disk with a transfer rate of 50MB/sec:
    - Swap out time: 2000 ms
    - Swap in time: 2000 ms
    - Total context switch time due to swapping: 4000 ms (4 seconds)

### Reducing Context Switch Time
- **Memory Usage Awareness**: The context switch time can be reduced by minimizing the size of the memory being swapped. This can be achieved by:
  - Utilizing system calls such as `request_memory()` and `release_memory()` to inform the operating system of current memory usage.

## Conclusion
Understanding the intricacies of swapping, including the mechanisms, implications on context switching, and strategies for optimization, is crucial for effective memory management in operating systems.

# Context Switch Time and Swapping

## Constraints on Swapping
- **Pending I/O Operations**: 
  - A process cannot be swapped out if it has pending I/O operations, as this would lead to the I/O being directed to the wrong process.
  - To manage this, I/O operations can be transferred to kernel space before being sent to the I/O device, a method known as **double buffering**. However, this adds additional overhead.

- **Modern Swapping Practices**: 
  - Traditional swapping methods are not commonly used in modern operating systems. Instead, a modified version is employed, where swapping occurs only when free memory is critically low.

## Swapping on Mobile Systems
- **Limited Support for Swapping**: 
  - Mobile systems generally do not support traditional swapping due to:
    - **Flash Memory Constraints**: 
      - Limited storage capacity.
      - A restricted number of write cycles.
      - Lower throughput between flash memory and the CPU.
  
- **Memory Management Techniques**:
  - **iOS**: 
    - Requests apps to voluntarily release allocated memory.
    - Read-only data can be discarded and reloaded from flash memory if necessary.
    - Failure to free memory may lead to app termination.
  
  - **Android**: 
    - Terminates apps when free memory is low but saves the application state to flash for quick restart.

- **Paging Support**: 
  - Both iOS and Android operating systems support paging mechanisms.

## Swapping with Paging
- Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory and thus eliminates the problems of fitting varying sized memory chunks onto the backing store.

## Example: Intel 32 and 64-bit Architectures
- **Architecture Overview**: 
  - Intel's IA-32 architecture represents 32-bit CPUs, such as Pentium, while the IA-64 architecture includes current 64-bit CPUs.
  - Various chip variations exist, focusing on the main concepts.

## Example: Intel IA-32 Architecture
- **Segmentation and Paging**:
  - The IA-32 architecture supports both segmentation and segmentation with paging.
  - Each segment can be up to 4 GB in size.
  - A process can utilize up to 16K segments, which are divided into two partitions:
    - **Private Segments**: 
      - Up to 8K segments are private to each process, stored in the Local Descriptor Table (LDT).
    - **Shared Segments**: 
      - Up to 8K segments are shared among all processes, stored in the Global Descriptor Table (GDT).

# Intel IA-32 Architecture and ARM Architecture

## Intel IA-32 Architecture

### Address Generation Process
- The **CPU** generates a **logical address**.
- This logical address is processed by:
  - **Segmentation Unit**: Produces **linear addresses** from the selector.
  - **Paging Unit**: Converts linear addresses to **physical addresses** in main memory.
    - This unit functions similarly to a **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**.
  
### Page Sizes
- Common page sizes in IA-32 architecture are **4 KB** or **4 MB**.

### Logical to Physical Address Translation
- The translation process involves converting logical addresses to physical addresses through segmentation and paging mechanisms.

### Page Address Extensions (PAE)
- **32-bit address limitations** prompted Intel to introduce **Page Address Extensions (PAE)**.
- PAE allows **32-bit applications** to access more than **4 GB** of memory space.
- The paging scheme was upgraded to a **3-level scheme**:
  - Top two bits refer to a **Page Directory Pointer Table**.
  - **Page-directory** and **page-table entries** were expanded to **64 bits**.
- This extension increases the address space to **36 bits**, allowing access to **64 GB** of physical memory.

### Intel x86-64 Architecture
- The current generation of Intel x86 architecture supports **64-bit addressing**, theoretically allowing access to over **16 exabytes**.
- However, practical implementations utilize **48-bit addressing**:
  - Page sizes include **4 KB**, **2 MB**, and **1 GB**.
  - A **four-level paging hierarchy** is employed.
- PAE can also be utilized, enabling **virtual addresses** of **48 bits** and **physical addresses** of **52 bits**.

## ARM Architecture

### Overview
- The **ARM architecture** is a dominant platform for mobile devices (e.g., Apple iOS, Google Android).
- It features a modern, energy-efficient **32-bit CPU**.

### Page Sizes
- ARM architecture supports various page sizes:
  - **4 KB** and **16 KB pages**
  - **1 MB** and **16 MB pages** (referred to as **sections**).

### Paging Mechanism
- ARM employs a **one-level paging** system for sections and a **two-level paging** system for smaller pages.

## Key Concepts
- **Segmentation**: A memory management technique that divides memory into different segments for easier management.
- **Paging**: A memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory and thus helps in managing large amounts of memory efficiently.
- **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: A hardware component that handles the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses.
- **Page Address Extension (PAE)**: A feature that allows 32-bit processors to access more than 4 GB of RAM by extending the address space.
- **x86-64**: An extension of the x86 architecture that supports 64-bit computing.

This summary captures the essential details of the Intel IA-32 and ARM architectures, focusing on address generation, paging mechanisms, and the implications of architectural advancements.


## Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) Structure

The chunk discusses the architecture of the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) used in memory management, specifically detailing a two-level TLB system. This system enhances the efficiency of virtual-to-physical address translation.

### Key Components of the TLB

1. **Two Levels of TLBs**:
   - **Outer Level**:
     - Comprises two micro TLBs:
       - **Data TLB**: Handles data memory accesses.
       - **Instruction TLB**: Manages instruction memory accesses.
   - **Inner Level**:
     - Contains a single main TLB that is checked after the outer TLBs.

### TLB Lookup Process

The lookup process for the TLB operates in a specific sequence:
1. The **inner TLB** is checked first for a translation.
2. If there is a **miss** (i.e., the required translation is not found), the **outer TLBs** are checked next.
3. If there is still a miss after checking the outer TLBs, the CPU performs a **page table walk** to retrieve the necessary page table entry from memory.

### Page Sizes and Addressing

The chunk also outlines the various page sizes and their corresponding offsets:
- **Page Sizes**:
  - 4 KB or 16 KB pages
  - 1 MB or 16 MB sections
- **Addressing**:
  - The system uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, which allows for a wide range of virtual address spaces.

### Summary Table

| TLB Level   | Type           | Function                     |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Outer TLB  | Data TLB      | Handles data accesses        |
| Outer TLB  | Instruction TLB| Manages instruction accesses  |
| Inner TLB  | Main TLB      | Final check for translations  |

### Conclusion of Chapter 9

This chunk concludes Chapter 9 of the text, emphasizing the importance of an efficient TLB structure in modern operating systems for optimizing memory access and management. The multi-level TLB system is designed to minimize the time taken for address translation, thereby enhancing overall system performance.
