# Synchronization
> [!note] Multi-threaded programs
> Threads **cooperate** in multithreaded programs.
> - To **share resources**, access shared data structures.
> - To **coordinate** their execution.
> 
> For correctness, this *cooperation needs to be controlled.*
> 
> > [!faq]- Why do we need synchronization.
> > 1. Thread schedule is **non-deterministic**
> > 	- scheduling is **not under program control.**
> > 	- threads *interleave executions* **arbitrarily** and **at different rates**.
> > 	- behavior changes when re-run program.
> > 2. *Multi-word operations* are **not atomic**.
> > 3. Compiler/ hardware *instruction reordering*.
