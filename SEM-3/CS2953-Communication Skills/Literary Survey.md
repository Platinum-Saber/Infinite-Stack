## 2. Green AI

_Authors:_ Roy Schwartz, Jesse Dodge, Noah A. Smith, Oren Etzioni

### Overview:

The paper discusses the increasing computational demands of deep learning research and its negative environmental impact. The authors advocate for "Green AI," which focuses on developing more energy-efficient models rather than pursuing state-of-the-art results through excessive computational power ("Red AI").

### Key Contributions:

- Emphasis on energy-efficient AI: The paper argues for including computational efficiency as an evaluation criterion in AI research alongside accuracy.
- Carbon footprint: The rising carbon emissions of training large models are highlighted, with BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet serving as key examples of computationally expensive models.
- "Price tag" for models: The authors propose reporting the financial and environmental costs of training models as a standard practice.

### Evaluation:

The authors compare 60 papers from top AI conferences and show that most focus solely on accuracy improvements, neglecting efficiency. They present metrics like Floating Point Operations (FPO) as a way to measure and reduce computational costs.

### Conclusion:

The paper advocates for a shift toward Green AI, encouraging AI researchers to prioritize environmentally friendly methods that can democratize access to deep learning by making it affordable and accessible.

- **Unified Text and Image Masking:**  
    LayoutLMv3 proposes a simple architecture that unifies MLM for text and MIM for image modalities, making it the first multimodal pre-trained model for Document AI that does not rely on CNN-based backbones like Faster R-CNN.
    
- **Word-Patch Alignment (WPA):**  
    A new objective that aligns image patches with corresponding text words, improving the model's ability to understand and integrate visual and textual information.
    
- **Performance Across Tasks:**  
    LayoutLMv3 achieves **state-of-the-art results** in both text-centric tasks (e.g., form understanding and visual question answering) and image-centric tasks (e.g., document classification and layout analysis), showing its flexibility in handling diverse Document AI tasks.
    

### **Evaluation:**

The model is evaluated on five public benchmarks, including **FUNSD, CORD, RVL-CDIP, DocVQA**, and **PubLayNet**, where it consistently outperforms previous models, proving its effectiveness in both **text-centric** and **image-centric** Document AI tasks.

### **Conclusion:**

LayoutLMv3's unified architecture for handling text and image modalities represents a significant advancement in Document AI. By eliminating the reliance on CNN-based image processing, it simplifies the model design while achieving **superior performance** on various document understanding tasks.
