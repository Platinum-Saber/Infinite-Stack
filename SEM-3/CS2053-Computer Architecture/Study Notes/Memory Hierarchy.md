## Accessing Memory
- The **address bus** activates a memory cell at a particular location. This prepares the memory cell for read or write operation that will occur.
- The **control bus** specifies the action done on the particular activated memory location. Typically whether read or write action is performed.
- **Data bus** carries the relevant data to or from the memory cell depending on the control signal.

> [!tip]- Address bus & Control bus are unidirectional. The data bus can carry signals both ways but only in one direction at a time.

### Reading From & Writing to Memory
> [!info] Reading From Memory
> - **Address** of memory location to read is placed on *Address Bus*.
> - **Read Signal** (RD) in *Control Bus* is activated.
> - **Data** Is fetched (read) from *Data Bus*.

> [!info] Writing to Memory
> - **Address** of the memory location to write is placed on *Address Bus*.
> - **Data** is placed on *Data Bus.*
> - **Write Signal** (WR) in *Control Bus* is activated.

### Connecting Memory & CPU
- Details of handling different memory modules & memory hierarchy is *off load* to **memory controller**.

### Addressing Modes

#### 1. PC-relative Addressing

- **Instructions**: `auipc`, `jal`, and branch instructions (`beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`, etc.)
- The effective address is calculated relative to the current value of the Program Counter (PC).


> [!code] Example code
```assembly
auipc x5, 20  # x5 = PC + 20; here rd is X5

jal x1, 20  # x1 = PC + 20; jump to PC + 20

beq x5, x6, label  # If x5 == x6, jump to the address at label
```

<br>

#### 2. Register-offset (Base + Offset) Addressing

- **Instructions**: `jalr`, `addi`, and all memory instructions (`lw`, `sw`, `lb`, `sb`, etc.).
- The effective address is computed by adding a constant offset (an immediate value) to the contents of a base register.


> [!code] Example code
```assembly
jalr x1, x2, 0  # x1 = PC + 4; jump to address in x2 + 0

lw x5, 4(x10)  # Load word from memory address (x10 + 4) into x5
```

<br>
<br>

#### 3. Absolute Addressing

- **Instruction**: `lui`
- The `lui` instruction loads a 20-bit immediate value into the upper 20 bits of a register, effectively setting up a large constant or address.
- Directly addresses the register.

> [!code] Example code
```assembly
lui x5, 0x12345  # x5 = 0x12345000
addi x5, x5, 0x678  # x5 = 0x12345678 ; addi is used to complete the full address.
```

## Memory Hierarchy
- Organizing memory in a way that the slowness of larger memory doesn't reduce the overall performance of the system.
- Faster memory is expensive hence a small amount is used (*Registers, static RAM*). Slow memory isn't expensive hence can be used in large amounts(*Dynamic RAM*).

**Main objective of a memory system**,
- Have sufficient speed
- Have sufficient capacity
- Be as cheap as possible.

### Principal of Locality
- Refers to the tendency of a program to access the same data or nearby data multiple times.

> [!abstract]- Types of Locality
> - **Temporal Locality** : The `block` containing recently accessed items are likely to be accessed again.
> - **Spatial Locality** : Data stored near the previously accessed memory is likely to be accessed. (Nearby `blocks` tend to be accessed)

> [!example] Locality examples
> ```cpp
> 



```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
	int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i=0; i<n; i++){
		sum += a[i];
	}
	return sum;
}
```

### Inclusion Property
- **inclusion** guarantees that all data present in fast memory is also present in slower memory, ensuring data coherence and simplifying memory management in modern systems.
- Often data in lower levels of hierarchy are a **superset** of higher level memories.
