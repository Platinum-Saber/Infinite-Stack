Here's a detailed markdown study note based on the **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** content from the provided document.



## 1. Introduction to Microprocessor Programming
The fundamental building block of any computing device is the **microprocessor**, which operates based on an **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**. Understanding ISAs is crucial for programming microprocessors efficiently. Below are key components of a microprocessor:

### Microprocessor Components
- **Program Memory**: Stores the instructions for execution.
- **Registers**: Hold temporary data for operations, such as accumulators, flags, and special-purpose registers.
- **Program Counter (PC)**: Tracks the next instruction to be executed.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Stack**: Temporary storage for function calls.

## 2. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
### What is ISA?
ISA forms a bridge between software and hardware, defining the commands the processor can execute and how it interacts with memory, registers, and I/O. It covers:
- Native data types
- Instructions (like `li`, `addi`, `beq`)
- Addressing modes
- Memory and I/O handling

An example of an ISA is **x86**, commonly used in personal computers. Modern processors also include ISAs such as:
- **x86-64** (Intel & AMD)
- **ARM** (Used in mobile devices)
- **RISC-V** (An open-source ISA)

### Key ISA Types
- **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**: Uses a small, highly optimized set of instructions (e.g., RISC-V, ARM).
- **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)**: Has a large number of complex instructions to handle various tasks (e.g., x86).

## 3. RISC-V Architecture Overview
**RISC-V** is an open-source ISA developed by the RISC-V International organization. It is modular and scalable, meaning you can choose the extensions that fit your needs.

### RISC-V Key Concepts
- **Base Variants**: RV32I, RV64I, and RV128I for 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit systems, respectively.
- **Extensions**: Add extra functionalities such as:
  - **M**: Multiply/Division
  - **A**: Atomic operations
  - **F**: Floating-point operations
  - **D**: Double precision floating-point
  - **C**: Compressed instructions to reduce code size

### Instruction Formats
RISC-V instructions have several types, each serving a specific purpose:
- **R-Format**: Arithmetic operations (e.g., `add`, `mul`)
- **I-Format**: Immediate values and loads (e.g., `addi`, `lw`)
- **S-Format**: Store instructions (e.g., `sw`)
- **SB-Format**: Branch instructions (e.g., `beq`)
- **U-Format**: Upper immediate instructions (e.g., `lui`)
- **UJ-Format**: Jump instructions (e.g., `jal`)

![RISC-V Instruction Format](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa18/img/formats.png)

**Example:**
```assembly
addi x5, x6, 4  # Adds 4 to the value in x6, stores result in x5
```
In binary: `0x00430293`

## 4. Encoding Instructions in RISC-V
Instructions in RISC-V are **32-bits wide**. To optimize space, we have to encode the operation and operands efficiently:
- **Opcode** (7 bits): Defines the operation.
- **funct3** and **funct7**: Additional function codes for specific operations.
- **rs1, rs2**: Source registers.
- **rd**: Destination register.

## 5. Logical vs Arithmetic Shifts
- **Logical Shift**: Moves bits left or right and fills empty spaces with zeros. Primarily for unsigned numbers.
- **Arithmetic Shift**: Preserves the sign bit, making it useful for signed numbers.

Example:
```assembly
sll x5, x6, 1   # Logical left shift by 1, multiplies by 2
sra x5, x6, 1   # Arithmetic right shift by 1, divides by 2 and retains the sign
```

## 6. Example Implementations
RISC-V's open-source nature allows multiple implementations. Examples include:
- **SweRV** (by Western Digital)
- **SiFive** development boards

Explore more RISC-V hardware [here](https://riscv.org/exchanges/boards/).

## 7. Immediate Values
Immediate values are 12-bit numbers in RISC-V that are **sign-extended** to 32-bits before arithmetic operations. For example, with `addi`, the largest value is `2^11-1 = 2047` and the smallest is `-2048`.

Example:
```assembly
addi x5, x6, 2047  # Add 2047 to x6, store in x5
```

## 8. Exercises and Self-Practice
1. **Exercise 1**: What will be the result of the instruction `andi x5, x6, -4` if `x6 = 0xFFFFFFFF`?
2. **Exercise 2**: What is the largest immediate value allowed in a `lui` instruction?

## Introduction {#introduction}

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture designed with simplicity and modularity in mind. It uses a load-store architecture where memory operations are performed using specific load and store instructions.

### Key Features
- 32-bit instructions (RV32I base integer instruction set)
- Fixed-length instruction format
- Limited number of instruction formats
- Load-store architecture
- Simple addressing modes

## Instruction Formats {#instruction-formats}

RISC-V uses six basic instruction formats:

### 1. R-Type (Register)
Used for register-to-register operations.

```
| funct7 | rs2 | rs1 | funct3 | rd | opcode |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|----| -------|
| 31-25  |24-20|19-15| 14-12  |11-7| 6-0    |
```

Example:

| imm[11:0] | rs1 | funct3 | rd | opcode |
|-----------|-----|--------|----| -------|
| 31-20     |19-15| 14-12  |11-7| 6-0    |


Example:
```assembly
addi x5, x6, 10   # x5 = x6 + 10
lw   x5, 8(x6)    # Load word from memory
```

### 3. S-Type (Store)
Used for store instructions.

| imm[11:5] | rs2 | rs1 | funct3 | imm[4:0] | opcode |
|-----------|-----|-----|--------|-----------|---------|
| 31-25     |24-20|19-15| 14-12  | 11-7     | 6-0     |


Example:
```assembly
sw x5, 8(x6)      # Store word to memory
```

### 4. B-Type (Branch)
Used for conditional branches.

```
| imm[12|10:5] | rs2 | rs1 | funct3 | imm[4:1|11] | opcode |

```

### 6. J-Type (Jump)
Used for unconditional jumps.

```

```

## Memory Operations {#memory-operations}

### Load Instructions
- `lw` - Load word
- `lh` - Load halfword
- `lb` - Load byte

Example:
```assembly
# Load word from memory
lw x5, 12(x6)     # x5 = Memory[x6 + 12]

# Load address using pseudo-instruction
la x5, variable   # Load address of variable
```

### Store Instructions
- `sw` - Store word
- `sh` - Store halfword
- `sb` - Store byte

Example:
```assembly
# Store word to memory
sw x5, 12(x6)     # Memory[x6 + 12] = x5
```

## Branching and Jump Instructions {#branching-and-jump}

### Conditional Branches
- `beq` - Branch if equal
- `bne` - Branch if not equal
- `blt` - Branch if less than
- `bge` - Branch if greater than or equal

Example:
```assembly
      addi x5, x0, 10    # x5 = 10
loop: addi x5, x5, -1    # x5 = x5 - 1
      bne  x5, x0, loop  # Branch if x5 != 0
```

### Jump Instructions
- `jal` - Jump and link
- `jalr` - Jump and link register
- `ret` - Return (pseudo-instruction)

Example:
```assembly
    jal  x1, function  # Jump to function, save return address in x1
    # ... function code ...
    ret                # Return using pseudo-instruction
```

## Programming Examples {#programming-examples}

### Example 1: Sum of Numbers 1 to 10
```assembly
    # Initialize registers
    addi x5, x0, 0     # sum = 0
    addi x6, x0, 1     # i = 1
    addi x7, x0, 10    # limit = 10
loop:
    add  x5, x5, x6    # sum += i
    addi x6, x6, 1     # i++
    ble  x6, x7, loop  # if (i <= 10) goto loop
```

### Example 2: Case Conversion
```assembly
    # Convert between uppercase and lowercase
    # ASCII difference is bit 5 (0x20)
    li   x5, 'A'       # Load character
    xori x6, x5, 0x20  # Toggle case
```
