# Computer Architecture

<br>

>[!abstract]- Classes Of Computers
>- Desktop ðŸ–¥ 
>- Personal ðŸ–¥ 
>- Servers
>- Embedded ðŸ–¥ 
>- Cloud ðŸ–¥ 

>[!abstract]- Performance Metrics
>- Reliability
>- Capacity
>- Speed
>- Cost
>- Energy
>- Size

>[!FAQ]- What is **Computer Architecture**
>A blueprint that's visible to the programmer which contains key functional units, their interconnections, and instructions to program the `instruction set architecture`.
>- Ex :- x86, ARM

>[!FAQ]- What is **Computer Organization**
>The internal details of operational units, their interconnections, & control view of a computer designer.
>- Ex :- Intel & AMD both support x86 with different organizations

>[!FAQ]- What is **Computer Design**
>- It maps a given organization to a logic design, logic design to a silicon layout & chip packaging.
>- This is the view of the hardware designer.
>- Design decisions are based on constraints like circuit level delays, silicon real estate, heat generation & cost.

## Registers
>[!note]- Functionality of a register
>It's a type of memory located inside the CPU
>It can hold a single piece of data (useful in both data processing & control functionalities)

>[!example]- Examples for **Special Purpose Registers**
>- Program counter
>- Instruction register
>- Accumulator or working register
>- Flag/Status register

## Architectural Differences
>[!abstract]- Commonly identifiable differences
>- Length of microprocessors' data word (4, 8,16, 32, 64,128 bit)
>- Speed of instruction execution (clock rate determines processor speed)
>- Instruction set ( `x86, ARM, SPARC, PIC, RISCV`)
>- CPU architecture (`RISC ðŸ†š CISC`)
>- Size of direct addressable memory
>- Number and types of registers
>- Support Circuit performance
>- Comparability with existing software and hardware

>[!abstract]- Microprocessor ðŸ†š Microcontroller
>> [!info]- Microprocessor
>> CPU & various IO functions are packed as separate ICs
>
>>[!info]- Microcontroller
>>Most IO functions are integrated into the same package with CPU

## Processor Design to Program
>[!info]- **Programming Hierarchies**
>![[Pasted image 20240705095649.png]]

>[!warning]- Shortcomings of a **nano-processor**
>>[!error]- Lack of stages of instructions
>>Nano processor is single cycled not multi cycled
>
>>[!error] No **Pipelining**
>
>>[!error]- Missing Peripherals
>>- Memory : RAM
>>- Input Output methods (Memory mapped inputs/outputs)
>
>>[!error]- No way to program it
>
>>[!error]- Not Efficient/ Power
