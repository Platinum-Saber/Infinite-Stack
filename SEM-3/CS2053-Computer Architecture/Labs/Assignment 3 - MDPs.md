## Exercise 2: Best Policy

### Best Policy after iterating for 3 times:

| State | Policy                   |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 1     | East                     |
| 2     | East                     |
| 3     | - (Terminating State)    |
| 4     | East                     |
| 5     | East                     |
| 6     | South                    |

## Exercise 3: Coding

1. **Best policy at the end:**

    | State | Policy                   |
    |-------|---------------------------|
    | 1     | East                     |
    | 2     | East                     |
    | 3     | - (Terminating State)    |
    | 4     | East                     |
    | 5     | East                     |
    | 6     | South                    |

2. **On what iteration does the policy converge?**

   - The policy obtained at the end of the third iteration stays the same in further iterations, indicating that policy converges on the third iteration.

3. **How many iterations does it take for utilities to converge?**
