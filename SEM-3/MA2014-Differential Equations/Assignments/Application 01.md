The document contains several applied problems in differential equations, and I will walk you through the step-by-step process for solving each part of one of the applications. Let’s start with **Application 1: A Simple Mass-Spring System**.

### Problem Setup (Application 1, Part A)
You are tasked with determining:
1. The frequency of vibration when a machine is suddenly seized.
2. The maximum tension in the cable.
3. The maximum stress in the cable.
4. Whether the cable will break under the maximum stress.

We assume the system is modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator, where the elastic cable behaves like a spring.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution (Part A)

#### 1. **Formulation of the Differential Equation**
Using Newton’s 2nd Law and considering the forces acting on the machine (the elastic force of the cable and the gravitational force), we can set up a second-order differential equation. 

- The downward force due to gravity on the mass \( m \) is:
  $F_{\text{gravity}} = mg$

  where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( m \) is the mass of the machine.

- The restoring force of the spring (cable) is given by Hooke’s Law:
  $F_{\text{spring}} = -ky(t)$

  where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( y(t) \) is the displacement.

- Applying Newton’s second law:
 $m \frac{d^2y(t)}{dt^2} = -ky(t) + mg$
  

The term \( mg \) can be considered as the equilibrium displacement. Rearranging terms gives the standard harmonic oscillator equation:
\[
m \frac{d^2y(t)}{dt^2} + ky(t) = 0

This is a second-order linear differential equation representing the motion of the mass.

---

#### 2. **Natural Frequency**
The natural frequency \( \omega_n \) of the system is given by:
\[
\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

To compute this, we need to express the spring constant \( k \) in terms of the physical properties of the system.

The mass is given as:
\[
m = \frac{800 \, \text{lbf}}{g} \approx \frac{800}{32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2} = 24.84 \, \text{slugs}
\]

Given that the cable behaves like a spring, you can determine the spring constant \( k \) if other parameters such as the elongation are provided (or assumed from the context). Once you have \( k \), you can find the natural frequency \( \omega_n \).

---

#### 3. **Maximum Tension in the Cable**
The maximum tension occurs at the point of maximum displacement when the spring force is greatest. Using Hooke’s Law:
\[
T_{\text{max}} = k \Delta y_{\text{max}}
\]
where \( \Delta y_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum elongation of the cable.

---

#### 4. **Maximum Stress in the Cable**
Stress is defined as the force divided by the cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cable:
\[
\sigma = \frac{T_{\text{max}}}{A}
\]
The area of a circular cross-section is:
\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2
\]
where \( d \) is the diameter of the cable. Substituting the diameter \( d = 0.5 \, \text{inches} \), we can compute \( A \) and then the stress.

---

#### 5. **Cable Breakage Analysis**
You need to compare the calculated maximum stress to the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the cable material, which is given as \( 40,000 \, \text{psi} \). If the maximum stress exceeds the UTS, the cable will break. Otherwise, it will remain intact.

Would you like to go through the calculations in detail for any of the specific sub-parts? Or should we move on to another part of the project?

Sure! Let’s work through **Applications 2, 3, and 4** in detail, using **Laplace Transforms** where applicable and with step-by-step explanations. I’ll also use **MathJax** formatting for the math expressions.

### **Application 2: Heat Flow in Soil for Wine Cellar Design**

This problem involves solving the **heat diffusion equation**:
\[
\frac{\partial \theta(z, t)}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 \theta(z, t)}{\partial z^2}
\]
with the goal of determining how deep the roof of the wine cellar should be to ensure that the daily temperature variation at depth \( z \) is no more than 0.5°C.

Given:
- \( \theta(z, t) \) is the temperature at depth \( z \) and time \( t \),
- \( k = 1.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2/\text{hr} \) is the thermal conductivity of the soil.

#### Step-by-Step Solution Using Laplace Transform

We start by applying the **Laplace Transform** with respect to time \( t \), keeping the spatial variable \( z \) unchanged. This will allow us to convert the partial differential equation into an easier-to-solve ordinary differential equation in the Laplace domain.

#### 1. **Laplace Transform the Heat Equation**

The Laplace transform of \( \frac{\partial \theta(z,t)}{\partial t} \) is \( s \Theta(z, s) - \theta(z, 0) \), and the Laplace transform of \( \frac{\partial^2 \theta(z,t)}{\partial z^2} \) is \( \frac{\partial^2 \Theta(z,s)}{\partial z^2} \). Thus, the Laplace-transformed equation is:
\[
s \Theta(z, s) - \theta(z, 0) = k \frac{\partial^2 \Theta(z, s)}{\partial z^2}
\]
or:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \Theta(z, s)}{\partial z^2} - \frac{s}{k} \Theta(z, s) = -\frac{\theta(z, 0)}{k}
\]

#### 2. **Solve the Transformed Equation**

This is a second-order ordinary differential equation with respect to \( z \). The general solution is:
\[
\Theta(z, s) = A(s) e^{-\sqrt{\frac{s}{k}} z} + B(s) e^{\sqrt{\frac{s}{k}} z}
\]
where \( A(s) \) and \( B(s) \) are constants to be determined by boundary conditions.

#### 3. **Apply Boundary Conditions**

At the surface of the ground \( z = 0 \), the temperature variation is given by:
\[
\theta(0, t) = \theta_0 + A(0) \cos(\omega t)
\]
Taking the Laplace transform of this boundary condition:
\[
\Theta(0, s) = \frac{\theta_0 + A(0) \frac{\omega}{s^2 + \omega^2}}{s}
\]

At depth \( z = z_0 \), we want the amplitude to be less than 0.5°C:
\[
\left| \Theta(z_0, s) \right| \leq 0.5
\]

Solving for \( z_0 \), we use the amplitude decay relation from the solution form to estimate the depth required.

### **Application 3: Fluid Flow in an Open Channel**

This problem uses **Bernoulli’s equation** to model the flow of water in a horizontal channel with a given cross-sectional profile. We aim to find the **critical fluid height** and **minimum specific energy** for the given flow rate.

Given:
- The cross-sectional boundary height \( z = ax^4 \),
- The volume flow rate \( V = 4 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} \),
- The constant of proportionality for the channel \( a = 3 \, \text{m}^{-3} \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution

We use Bernoulli’s equation along a streamline:
\[
\frac{P_0}{\rho g} + \frac{u^2}{2g} + h = \text{constant}
\]
where:
- \( P_0 \) is atmospheric pressure,
- \( \rho \) is the fluid density,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( u \) is the flow velocity,
- \( h \) is the water height in the channel.

The **specific energy** \( E \) is:
\[
E = \frac{u^2}{2g} + h
\]
We want to minimize \( E \) with respect to the height \( h \), subject to the volume flow rate.

#### 1. **Volume Flow Rate Relation**

For a given height \( h \), the cross-sectional area of the channel is:
\[
A(h) = \int_{-b}^{b} (h - ax^4) dx
\]
where \( b \) is the half-width of the channel. The volume flow rate is related to the velocity \( u \) and area \( A(h) \) by:
\[
V = A(h) u
\]

#### 2. **Minimize Specific Energy**

To find the critical fluid height, differentiate \( E(h) \) with respect to \( h \) and set \( \frac{dE}{dh} = 0 \) to solve for \( h_{\text{critical}} \). This gives the **critical height** where the specific energy is minimized.

### **Application 4: Beam Deflection Under Uniform Load**

This application involves solving a fourth-order differential equation describing the deflection \( y(x) \) of a beam under a uniform load:
\[
\frac{d^4 y(x)}{dx^4} = \frac{q}{EI}
\]
with the boundary conditions:
- No deflection at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = L \): \( y(0) = y(L) = 0 \),
- No curvature at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = L \): \( y''(0) = y''(L) = 0 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution Using Laplace Transform

We’ll solve the fourth-order ordinary differential equation using **Laplace transforms**.

#### 1. **Take the Laplace Transform of the Equation**

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides gives:
\[
s^4 Y(s) = \frac{q}{EI}
\]
or:
\[
Y(s) = \frac{q}{EI s^4}
\]

#### 2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**

The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s^4} \) is \( \frac{x^3}{6} \). Thus, the solution for \( y(x) \) will be of the form:
\[
y(x) = \frac{q}{EI} \left( \frac{x^4}{24} + C_1 x^3 + C_2 x^2 + C_3 x + C_4 \right)
\]

#### 3. **Apply Boundary Conditions**

Using the boundary conditions \( y(0) = 0 \), \( y(L) = 0 \), \( y''(0) = 0 \), and \( y''(L) = 0 \), solve for the constants \( C_1 \), \( C_2 \), \( C_3 \), and \( C_4 \).

The final deflection equation \( y(x) \) will give the shape of the beam under the applied load.

---
