### 1. Introduction to Fourier Series
- The goal of Fourier series is to express a function as a sum of cosine and sine terms, which are called basis functions.
- Each term in the Fourier series is multiplied by coefficients, $a_n$ for cosines and $b_n$ for sines, which determine how much of each sine or cosine contributes to the overall function.
- The Fourier series of a function $f(x)$ is expressed as:
  $$f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx) \right)$$
- There is no $b_0$ term because $\sin(0) = 0$, making it irrelevant for $n = 0$.

### 2. Complex Form of Fourier Series
- The more elegant form involves complex exponentials, using $e^{inx}$, with coefficients $c_n$.
- The series goes from $n = -\infty$ to $n = \infty$ and simplifies the formulas.
- Eulerâ€™s formula, $e^{inx} = \cos(nx) + i\sin(nx)$, connects the real and complex forms of the Fourier series.

### 3. Orthogonality in Fourier Series
- **Key Concept:** Orthogonality, which means perpendicularity in the context of vectors, extends to functions. If the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors is zero, they are orthogonal.
- For Fourier series, orthogonality refers to the integral of the product of two different basis functions being zero:
  $$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(mx) \cos(nx) \, dx = 0 \quad \text{for} \, m \neq n$$
  Similarly, sine functions are orthogonal to cosine functions:
  $$
  \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(mx) \cos(nx) \, dx = 0
   $$
- This orthogonality property allows us to isolate individual coefficients from the series.

### 4. Finding the Fourier Coefficients
- To compute the Fourier coefficients, multiply the function $f(x)$ by a basis function (either cosine or sine), integrate from $-\pi$ to $\pi$, and apply orthogonality to eliminate other terms.
  - **For cosine coefficients $a_n$**:
    $$
    a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx
    $$
  - **For sine coefficients $b_n$**:
    $$
    b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx
    $$
  - **For $a_0$** (the constant term):
    $$
    a_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \, dx
    $$
    This represents the average value of $f(x)$ over the interval.

### 5. Example: Delta Function
- The delta function $\delta(x)$ is a highly singular function that spikes at $x = 0$ and is zero elsewhere.
- The delta function is an **even function**, meaning that all the sine coefficients $b_n$ are zero (since sine functions are odd).
- **Fourier Series for the Delta Function**:
  - All cosine coefficients $a_n$ for the delta function are constant:
    $$
    a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}
    $$
  - The series for the delta function between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ is:
    $$
    \delta(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} + \frac{1}{\pi} \left( \cos(x) + \cos(2x) + \cos(3x) + \dots \right)
    $$
  - This result shows that the delta function contains all harmonics in equal amounts, without decay.

### 1. Odd Functions and Fourier Series

- **Odd function**: A function is odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$. 
- **Sine functions** are odd, while **cosine functions** are even.
- For an odd function, all cosine terms in the Fourier series vanish. Thus, only sine terms (with $b_k$ coefficients) remain in the series expansion.

#### Example: Square Wave
- Consider a square wave, alternating between $-1$ and $1$, which is an odd function.
- The Fourier series for such a function involves sine waves only.

#### Fourier Coefficients for Sine Terms:
The formula for the sine coefficients $b_k$ is given by:

$$
b_k = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin(kx) \, dx
$$

The integrals are computed over half the period, from $0$ to $\pi$, and doubled due to symmetry.

#### Calculation of $b_k$:
For $k = 1, 3, 5, \dots$, we get non-zero terms, while for $k = 2, 4, 6, \dots$, the coefficients are zero.

##### First few coefficients:
- $b_1 = \frac{4}{\pi}$
- $b_2 = 0$
- $b_3 = \frac{4}{3\pi}$
- $b_4 = 0$
- $b_5 = \frac{4}{5\pi}$

#### Fourier Series for the Square Wave:
$$
f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \left( \sin(x) + \frac{1}{3} \sin(3x) + \frac{1}{5} \sin(5x) + \dots \right)
$$

This series contains only odd harmonics (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), and the coefficients decrease slowly because the function has jumps (i.e., it is not smooth).

---

### 2. Even Functions and Fourier Series

- **Even function**: A function is even if $f(-x) = f(x)$. 
- For an even function, only cosine terms appear in the Fourier series, and all sine terms vanish.

#### Example: Ramp Function
- A ramp function is obtained by integrating the square wave. This function is even and has smoother transitions (no jumps).
- For this ramp function, we compute the cosine coefficients $a_k$ instead of the sine coefficients.

#### Fourier Series for the Ramp Function:
By integrating the square wave's Fourier series, we get:

$$
f(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \cos(x) - \frac{\cos(3x)}{9} - \frac{\cos(5x)}{25} - \dots
$$

This series contains only even harmonics, and the coefficients decay faster (proportional to $k^2$) because the ramp function is smoother than the square wave.

---

### 3. Key Concepts and Observations

- **Smoother functions** lead to faster decay of Fourier coefficients. For instance, the ramp function (which is smooth) has coefficients that decay faster than those of the square wave (which has jumps).
  
- **Fourier coefficients decay more slowly** for rough functions (like the square wave) and more rapidly for smooth functions (like the ramp).

---

### 4. Derivatives and Fourier Series

- **Derivative of a Fourier Series**: 
  If $f(x)$ has a Fourier series $f(x) = \sum c_k e^{ikx}$, then the derivative of $f(x)$ has a Fourier series:

  $$
  \frac{df}{dx} = \sum ik c_k e^{ikx}
  $$

  The derivative introduces a factor of $ik$, making the coefficients larger (indicating more high-frequency components, which correspond to "noisier" functions).

---

### 5. Shifts and Fourier Series

- **Shifted Function**: 
  For a shifted function $f(x - d)$, the Fourier coefficients are modified by a phase factor:

  $$
  f(x - d) = \sum c_k e^{ik(x - d)} = \sum c_k e^{ikx} e^{-ikd}
  $$

  The magnitude of the Fourier coefficients remains unchanged, but their phase is shifted by $e^{-ikd}$.

---

### 6. Summary

- Fourier series are powerful tools for representing periodic functions as sums of sine and cosine waves.
- The **smoothness** of the function directly affects how fast the Fourier coefficients decay.
- **Derivatives** and **shifts** in the function have simple rules in the Fourier domain, making Fourier series particularly useful for solving differential equations and other mathematical problems.
