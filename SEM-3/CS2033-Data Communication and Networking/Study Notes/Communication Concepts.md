# Information Representation
- **Bit** : The smallest unit of information a computer can store. (*1 or 0*)
- **Code** : Association of combination of bits with information.

### Common coding standards (ISO, IEEE)

> [!info] ASCII
>A **7-bit code** that assigns a unique combination of bits to English keyboard characters.
>
>> [!image]- ASCII Table
>> ![[Pasted image 20240828155533.png]]

> [!info] Unicode
> Extends ASCII and is **32-bit**, supporting multiple writing systems, scientific symbols, and more.

# Signals
- **Signals**: Used to transmit data via a medium like copper cables, optical fiber, or air.
- Generated by changing the strength of s particular form of energy.

> [!info] Analog
> **Continuously varying** and can take any value between two points at any time.

> [!info] Digital
> Can take **only specific values** and remain at a value for a period before changing.


## Types Of Signals
> [!info] Periodic 
> - Repeat their wave pattern continuously over time.
> - Can be **continuous** or **discrete**.

> [!info] Aperiodic
> - No repeating pattern.
> - Can be continuous or discrete.

## Properties Of Periodic Signals

- **Amplitude**: 
	The *strength of the wave* at a given time, measured in volts (v), amperes (A), or decibels (dB).
> [!image]- Amplitude diagram
> ![[Pasted image 20240828161942.png]]


- **Period (T)**: 
	*Time* between two *consecutive similar points* in the wave; time taken for the pattern to repeat.
> [!image]- Period diagram
> ![[Pasted image 20240828162032.png]]

- **Frequency (f)**: 
	Number of *oscillations* per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). $f = \frac{1}{T}$​.
> [!image]- Frequency diagram
> ![[Pasted image 20240828162247.png]]

- **Phase**: 
	The difference between two waves. Two waves are **in phase** if they *reach corresponding points simultaneously;* otherwise, they are **out of phase**.
> [!image]- Phase diagram
> ![[Pasted image 20240828162618.png]]

- **Wavelength (λ)**: The physical distance between matching points of adjacent cycles of the waveform. It is related to the speed of the signal $(c)$ and frequency $(f)$ by $\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$​.

# Fourier Series
- Any periodic function can be expressed as a sum of sine functions with varying amplitude, frequency, and phase shift. This is critical in **Signal Filtering**.

# Bandwidth 

> [!info] Bandwidth (Analog)
> The range of frequencies a medium can handle, measured in Hertz (Hz).

> [!info] Bandwidth (Digital)
> The maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over a medium.

> [!image]- Bandwidth diagram

# Baud Rate
- **Baud Rate**: The rate at which signal components change.
- Data is divided into bit strings that are represented by a unique signal component (**element**) at the *transmitter*.

> [!image]- Baud Rate diagram
> ![[Pasted image 20240828170544.png]]

<br>

# Data Rate
- **Data Rate** refers to the amount of data transmitted over a communication medium per unit time.
- Typically measured in **bits per second (bps)**.

> [!equation]- Equations
>-  If the number of bits carried in a signal component (element) is n,
> $B = 2^n$
> Where $B$ is the number of **different** signal components.
> $$\therefore \ n\ =\ \log_2{B}$$
> 
>- Suppose the baud rate is $2f$
> $Data\ Rate\ =\ Baud\ Rate\ ×\ n$
> $$Data\ Rate\ = 2\ f\ \log_2{B}$$

# Sampling
> [!note]- Sampling overview
> Sampling is a fundamental concept in digital signal processing that involves **converting a continuous-time (analog) signal into a discrete-time (digital) signal**. This process is essential because digital systems, such as **computers, can only process discrete data**. Sampling enables the representation of analog signals in a form suitable for digital processing, storage, and transmission. 


- At the receiver the signals must be sampled and **converted** to the corresponding bit stream.
- Sampling should happen at **at-least** *the same rate* as the **Baud Rate**.

<br>

# Signal to Noise Ratio
- Ratio between the **signal power** and the **noise power**.
- Measured in `dB`.
- **High** S/N is desirable.
> [!equation]- S/N ratio
> $$(S/N)\ ratio\ =\ 10\ \log{\frac{S}{N}}$$

<br>

# Nyquist Theorem

- For a **noiseless channel**, a signal can be *perfectly reconstructed* if **sampled** at **twice** its *highest frequency*.

<br>

# Shannon's Theorem
- The *maximum data rate* of a medium is determined by its **bandwidth** and **signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)**.
> [!equation]- Max data rate
> $$data\ rate\ =\ bandwidth\ *\ \log_2{(1\ +\ \frac{S}{N})}$$
