Here’s a breakdown of each question with the key concepts and explanations to help you prepare for your exam.

### Q1: Introduction and Communication Principles

**a) Types of Communication**
1. **One-Way Communication**: In one-way communication, information flows from sender to receiver without a response. An example is a TV broadcast, where the audience only receives information without interacting.
   
2. **Two-Party Interactive Communication**: This involves two parties where both can send and receive messages, such as a phone call or video call. Each party can interact, enabling a back-and-forth exchange.

3. **Multi-Party Interactive Communication**: Here, multiple participants are involved in sending and receiving messages, like in a group chat or video conference where everyone can interact simultaneously.

**Real-Time vs. Non-Real-Time Communication**:
   - **Real-Time Communication**: Information is exchanged instantly, allowing immediate feedback. Examples include video calls or live chat.
   - **Non-Real-Time Communication**: Messages are not received or responded to immediately. Examples include emails and recorded video messages, where there’s a delay in response.

**b) Function of the Application Layer on the Internet**
   - The application layer provides the protocols and services that support user applications, like web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), and file transfer (FTP). It enables communication between applications on different devices.

**c) Client and Server Communication**
   - **Client**: Sends requests to the server (e.g., a user requesting a webpage).
   - **Server**: Receives the request, processes it, and sends a response back (e.g., sending the requested webpage).
   - Communication often happens over TCP/IP, where the client initiates a connection, and the server responds.

**d) Minimum Signal Sampling Rate**
   - According to the **Nyquist Theorem**, the minimum sampling rate should be twice the highest frequency of the signal to ensure accurate reconstruction.

**e) Data Transmission Rate and Sampling Rate Relationship**
   - The data transmission rate (bits per second) depends on the sampling rate. If a signal is sampled twice per bit period, the rate in bits per second is half the sampling rate.

### Q2: Encoding/Modulation, Transmission Media

**a) Encoding vs. Modulation**
   - **Encoding**: The process of converting data into a specific format for transmission, such as converting text to binary.
   - **Modulation**: The process of varying a carrier signal to carry data, which is essential for transmitting over long distances.

**b) Methods of Digital Signal Modulation**
   1. **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**: Varies the amplitude of the carrier.
   2. **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**: Varies the frequency of the carrier.
   3. **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**: Varies the phase of the carrier.

**c) Features of Optical Fibre**
   - High bandwidth, low attenuation, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and long-distance transmission.

**d) Popular Copper-Based Ethernet Cable**
   - **Category 6 (Cat 6)** cables are widely used. They are constructed with twisted pairs to reduce interference and support high data rates.

### Q3: Wireless Networks

**a) Popularity of Mobile Devices**
   - Mobility, portability, accessibility to information, and support for various applications are driving their popularity.

**b) Basic Service Set (BSS) and Independent BSS (IBSS)**
   - **BSS**: A basic configuration for a wireless network with an access point (AP) connecting devices.
   - **IBSS**: An ad-hoc network without an AP, useful for temporary networks.

**c) Low-Power Transmitters in Cellular Networks**
   - Reduces interference with other cells and prolongs battery life on mobile devices.

**d) Handoff in Cellular Networks**
   - When a mobile device moves from one cell to another, it transfers its connection to a new cell. This handoff process ensures continuous service as the user moves.

### Q4: Switching and Upper Layers

**a) Crossbar Switch Diagram and Explanation**
   - A crossbar switch allows multiple connections by using intersecting lines for each input and output path, ensuring direct connections.

**b) Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI) in Packet-Switched Networks**
   - VCIs are unique identifiers used in packet-switched networks to route packets along a pre-established path. Switches use VCIs to forward packets based on their destination.

**c) Internet Networking Model Diagram**
   - This model includes hosts (computers and devices), networks (connections between devices), and routers (forward data between networks).

**d) Transport Layer Protocols**
   - **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures data delivery.
   - **UDP**: Unreliable, connectionless protocol used for fast transmission where reliability is less important.

### Q5: Web and HTTP

**a) Structure of the WWW**
   - **Browser**: User interface for accessing the web.
   - **Server**: Hosts and serves web content.
   - **HTML/HTTP**: Markup language for content and protocol for data transfer.

**b) HTTP Response Codes**
   - **301 Moved Permanently**: Indicates the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
   - Another example: **404 Not Found**, meaning the requested page doesn’t exist.

**c) HTTP as a Stateless Protocol**
   - Each HTTP request is independent, with no memory of previous interactions. Stateless design reduces server load and simplifies data handling.

**d) HTTP Language Preferences**
   - HTTP headers (Accept-Language) enable websites to serve content in different languages based on user preferences or location.

### Q6: P2P, IP Telephony

**a) File Sharing on BitTorrent**
   - Files are split into pieces and distributed across multiple peers. Each peer downloads and uploads pieces simultaneously, increasing efficiency.

**b) P2P Technology Applications**
   - 1. **Decentralized Storage**: Services like IPFS.
   - 2. **Streaming**: Services like Twitch use P2P for load balancing.

**c) SIP User Agent Functions**
   - **Registrar**: Registers a user’s location.
   - **Proxy**: Helps direct calls between users. Both functions are essential for call routing and user registration.

**d) Types of SIP Addresses**
   - **SIP URI** (like an email address) for user identification.
   - **Tel URI** (telephone number format) for calls based on phone numbers.

**e) SIP Registrar Function**
   - Maintains a registry of user locations for call routing. When a user registers, the SIP Registrar updates the user’s current location to enable incoming calls.
