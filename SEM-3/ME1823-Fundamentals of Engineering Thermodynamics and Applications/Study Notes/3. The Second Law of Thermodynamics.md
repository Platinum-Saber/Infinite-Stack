# Second Law
- Introduces a **directionality** to *heat transfer*.
- Heat doesn't flow from a cooler body to a hotter body on its own.
- **Only** by means of a *work input* will heat flow from a *cooler body* to a *hotter body*

<br>

>[!note]- **Kelvin-Plank** Statement of the **Second Law**
>It's **impossible** for any device that operates on a *cycle* to exchange heat with just a single [[#Thermal Reservoir]] and produce a *net amount of work*.
>
>- This is the reason that the *efficiency* of a *heat engine* **can't** reach a 100%.
>- For the system to keep doing work a *deliberate heat rejection* **must be** done.

>[!note]- **Carnot** Principle
>- The efficiency of a **reversible** *heat engine* operating between 2 thermal reservoirs is *always grater* than the efficiency of an **irreversible** *heat engine* operating between the same thermal reservoirs.
>- Reversible heat engines are called as [[#Carnot Heat Engine]] .

>>All reversible heat engines operating between the **same two reservoirs** have the **same efficiency**.

### Thermal Reservoir
>[!note]- **Definition**
>A body that can either *absorb* or *supply* heat at *constant temperature*.
>- **Heat Source** : A thermal reservoir that *supply* heat.
>- **Heat Sink** : A thermal reservoir that *absorb* heat.

### Performance of Heat Pumps & Refrigerators 
- **REF Objective** : Cool an environment by pumping heat out from the environment concerned.
- **HP Objective** : Heat up an environment by pumping heat into the environment concerned.
- We use the term *Coefficient of Performance(COP)* when measuring their efficiency. COP is always grater than 1 hence its used to clear the ambiguity of being called efficiency as efficiency is always less than 1.

>[!note]- Coefficient of Performance
>##### COP of Heat Pump = $\frac {Q_H}{W_{in}}\ =\ \frac {Q_H}{Q_H\ -\ Q_L}\ =\ \frac {1}{1 -\ \frac {Q_L}{Q_H}}$
>
>##### COP of Refrigerator = $\frac {Q_L}{W_{in}}\ =\ \frac {Q_L}{Q_H\ -\ Q_L}\ =\ \frac {1}{\frac {Q_H}{Q_L}\ -\ 1}$

### Kelvin Temperature Scale
>[!note]- Reversible Heat Engines
>![[Pasted image 20240815230421.png]]
>From the First Law,
>#### $\nu_1\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{Q_{L1}}{Q_{H1}}$
>#### $\nu_2\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{Q_{L2}}{Q_{H2}}$
>
>Efficiency is independent of the properties of the working fluids
>#### $\frac{Q_{L}}{Q_{H}}\ =\ f(\ T_H, T_L\ )$
>
>#### $\frac{Q_{L}}{Q_{H}}\ =\frac {\psi (T_L)}{\psi (T_H)}$
>
>#### $\psi (T)\ =\ T$ ; Here *T* is temperature in **Kelvin** 
>
>#### $\frac{Q_{L}}{Q_{H}}\ =\frac {T_L}{T_H}$
>
>#### $\nu_{rev}\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{T_{L}}{T_{H}}$

# Entropy
### Clausius Theorem

> [!equation]
> #### $$\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T}\ \le \ \ 0 $$
> 
Where:
>- $\delta Q$: Heat transfer
>- $T$: Absolute temperature at which the transfer takes place

> [!image]- Clausius Theorem diagram
> ![[Pasted image 20240909160539.png]]

### Interpretation of Clausius Inequality:
- **Reversible process**: $\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} = 0$
- **Irreversible process**: $\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} < 0$
- **Impossible process**: $\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} > 0$

### Application in Heat Engines and Heat Pumps
For a **reversible heat engine** operating between two thermal reservoirs, the Clausius Theorem can be applied:

$$
\frac{Q_H}{T_H} - \frac{Q_L}{T_L} \leq 0
$$

Where:
- $Q_H$: Heat added from the high-temperature reservoir ($T_H$)
- $Q_L$: Heat rejected to the low-temperature reservoir ($T_L$)

## Entropy: A Corollary of the 2nd Law

> [!NOTE]- Entropy
> **Entropy (S)** is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, and it emerges as a natural consequence of the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**. 
> >[!equation]- Entropy change between two states can be expressed as:
> > 
> > $$
> > \Delta S = \int_1^2 \frac{\delta Q}{T}
> > $$


### Characteristics of Entropy:
- **For reversible processes**: Entropy can be calculated directly using the above equation.
- **For irreversible processes**: Entropy change cannot be directly calculated from this equation.

> [!warning] Entropy is **not a conserved property**; it increases in isolated systems due to irreversibilities.

---

## Principle of Increase of Entropy

> [!equation] The **Principle of Entropy Increase** states that for an isolated system:
> $$
> \Delta S_{\text{isolated}} \geq 0
> $$
> 

### Case 1: Reversible Process

> [!equation] For a **reversible adiabatic** (isentropic) process, the entropy remains constant:
> $$
> dS = \frac{dQ}{T} = 0
> $$
> 

### Case 2: Irreversible Process

> [!equation] For an **irreversible adiabatic** process, the entropy increases:
> $$
> \Delta S_{\text{system}} > 0
> $$
> 
> For a thermodynamic cycle, the total change in entropy is always non-negative:
> $$
> \Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surrounding}} \geq 0
> $$
> 

> [!important] This implies:
> - **Irreversible processes** generate entropy.
> - **Reversible processes** maintain constant entropy.

## Temperature-Entropy (T-s) Diagram
The **T-s diagram** is a powerful tool to visualize changes in entropy during thermodynamic processes. The **Carnot Cycle**, for instance, can be plotted on this diagram, showing the relationship between temperature ($T$) and entropy ($S$) throughout the cycle.

### Key Points on the T-s Diagram:
- **Vertical lines** represent **isentropic (constant entropy)** processes.
- **Horizontal lines** represent **isothermal (constant temperature)** processes.
