# Basic Concepts

### The System Concept

>[!FAQ]- What is a `System`
>- It's a region of space enclosed by a distinguishable boundary (can be imaginary) and contains matter inside it. 
>- The system must be simple and comprehensive.

>[!abstract]- Different Types of Systems
>>[!info]- Open System
>>Open systems are also called as `Control Volumes`

>[!note]- **Thermodynamic Properties**
>- Properties are known as **point functions**.
>>[!warning] They depend only on the point, not the path followed to reach the state.
>
>>[!example]- Examples for thermodynamic properties
>>- Pressure                       (intensive)
>>- Volume                        (extensive)
>>- Entropy                        (extensive)
>>- Mass                            (extensive)
>>- Temperature                (intensive)
>>- Enthalpy                      (extensive)
>>- Specific heat capacity (intensive)
>>- Internal energy           (extensive)

>[!info]- **Mass-Normalized Properties**
>>[!warning] All mass normalized properties are intensive properties

>[!FAQ]- What is a **Thermodynamic State**
>- It's an instance of a system defined by properties.
>- Properties are `state variables`

>[!FAQ]- What is **Thermodynamic Equilibrium**
>It's a state of a system that experiences no change.
>>[!abstract] Conditions to satisfy for `Thermodynamic Equilibrium`
>>- Mechanical Equilibrium
>>- Chemical Equilibrium
>>- Phase Equilibrium
>>- Thermal Equilibrium

### Processes/ Cycles
>[!abstract]- Common Thermodynamic Process
>>[!info]- Isobaric Process
>>Pressure remains constant
>
>>[!info]- Isochoric Process
>>Volume remains constant
>>
>
>>[!info]- Isothermal Process
>>Temperature remains constant
>
>>[!info]- Isentropic Process
>>The entropy remains constant
>
>>[!info]- Polytrophic Process
>> Processes that obey the equation $P\ V^n\ =\ Constant$ 
>> *n* is the **polytrophic** index.
>
>>[!info]- Adiabatic Process
>>No heat transfer tacking place
>

>[!note]- **Quasi-Equilibrium** Process
>- A process whose all intermediate states are equilibrium states.
>- These processes are done extremely slowly
>- This is a hypothetical process & can't be found in real life.
>- Therefore most of the practical processes will be depicted by dotted lines(-----)

>[!note]- **Reversible** Process
>- It's a process that can be reversed without leaving any trace on the surrounding
>- System and the surrounding both revert to their original states.
>>[!warning] Reversible process is only an idealization. Thermodynamic cycles aren't always reversible.

### Energy
>[!FAQ]- What is **Energy**
>The capacity to work or the ability to cause changes

>[!abstract]- Energy Types
>>[!info]- Macroscopic Energy
>>- Energies which a system possesses as a whole *with respect to some* **outside reference frame**.
>>>[!example] Examples
>>>- Potential energy
>>>- Kinetic energy
>
>>[!info]- Microscopic Energy
>>- Energy related to the random movement of the molecular structure of a system and the degree of molecular activity.
>>- Sum of all the microscopic energies are called the `internal energy` of a system.
>>>[!warning] Independent of outside reference frames.
>>
>>>[!example] Examples
>>>- Translational kinetic energy
>>>- Vibrational kinetic energy
>>>- Rotational kinetic energy
>>>- Spin energy

>[!note]- Total Energy (E)
>$$E =\ U +\ E_k +\ E_p$$
>$$E =\ U +\ \frac{1}{2}\ m\ C^2\ +\ mgz$$
>>[!tip] Specific total energy
>>$$e =\ u\ +\ \frac{1}{2}\ C^2 +\ gz$$

>[!note]- Heat & Work
>- Both are *transitional forms* of energies (Heat has meaning only in transition)
>- Both can be identified as they cross the boundary (`boundary phenomina`)
>- Due to heat & work transfer, the `intrinsic energy` of a system changes.
>- Both depend on the path they follow in a process. (`path functions`)

>[!note]- Work
>>[!tip] Electrical Work
>>$$W_{elect}\ = \int {V I}\ dt$$
>
>>[!tip] Mechanical Work
>>$$W_{mech}\ = \int {F}\ ds$$
>
>>[!tip] Moving Boundary Work
>>$$W_b\ = \int{P}\ dV$$
