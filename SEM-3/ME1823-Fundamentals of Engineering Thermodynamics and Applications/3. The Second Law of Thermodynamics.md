# Second Law
- Introduces a **directionality** to *heat transfer*.
- Heat doesn't flow from a cooler body to a hotter body on its own.
- **Only** by means of a *work input* will heat flow from a *cooler body* to a *hotter body*

<br>

>[!note]- **Kelvin-Plank** Statement of the **Second Law**
>It's **impossible** for any device that operates on a *cycle* to exchange heat with just a single [[#Thermal Reservoir]] and produce a *net amount of work*.
>
>- This is the reason that the *efficiency* of a *heat engine* **can't** reach a 100%.
>- For the system to keep doing work a *deliberate heat rejection* **must be** done.

>[!note]- **Carnot** Principle
>- The efficiency of a **reversible** *heat engine* operating between 2 thermal reservoirs is *always grater* than the efficiency of an **irreversible** *heat engine* operating between the same thermal reservoirs.
>- Reversible heat engines are called as [[#Carnot Heat Engine]] .

>#### $$W_{out,irr}\ <\ W_{out,rev}$$
>
>>[!info]- Corollary
>>All reversible heat engines operating between the **same two reservoirs** have the **same efficiency**.

<br>

>[!note]- **Clausius** Statement of Second Law
> It's **impossible** to construct a system which will *transfer heat* from a *cooler* body to a *hotter* body without *work* being done *on the system by the surrounding*.

### Thermal Reservoir
>[!note]- **Definition**
>A body that can either *absorb* or *supply* heat at *constant temperature*.
>- **Heat Source** : A thermal reservoir that *supply* heat.
>- **Heat Sink** : A thermal reservoir that *absorb* heat.

### Heat Engine Cycle
>[!example]- Components of a heat engine
>- Boiler  
>- Steam Turbine
>- Condenser
>- Feedwater Pump

>[!note]- Heat engine cycle

>#### Thermal Efficiency $=\ \frac {W_{out}}{Q_{in}}$
>#### $T.E\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\ \frac {Q_H\ -\ Q_L}{Q_H}$
>#### $T.E\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\ 1\ -\ \frac {Q_L}{Q_H}$

### Performance of Heat Pumps & Refrigerators 
- **REF Objective** : Cool an environment by pumping heat out from the environment concerned.
- **HP Objective** : Heat up an environment by pumping heat into the environment concerned.
- We use the term *Coefficient of Performance(COP)* when measuring their efficiency. COP is always grater than 1 hence its used to clear the ambiguity of being called efficiency as efficiency is always less than 1.

>[!note]- Coefficient of Performance
>##### COP of Heat Pump = $\frac {Q_H}{W_{in}}\ =\ \frac {Q_H}{Q_H\ -\ Q_L}\ =\ \frac {1}{1 -\ \frac {Q_L}{Q_H}}$
>
>##### COP of Refrigerator = $\frac {Q_L}{W_{in}}\ =\ \frac {Q_L}{Q_H\ -\ Q_L}\ =\ \frac {1}{\frac {Q_H}{Q_L}\ -\ 1}$

### Kelvin Temperature Scale
>[!note]- Reversible Heat Engines
>![[Pasted image 20240815230421.png]]
>From the First Law,
>#### $\nu_1\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{Q_{L1}}{Q_{H1}}$
>#### $\nu_2\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{Q_{L2}}{Q_{H2}}$
>
>Efficiency is independent of the properties of the working fluids
>#### $\frac{Q_{L}}{Q_{H}}\ =\ f(\ T_H, T_L\ )$
>
>#### $\frac{Q_{L}}{Q_{H}}\ =\frac {\psi (T_L)}{\psi (T_H)}$
>
>#### $\psi (T)\ =\ T$ ; Here *T* is temperature in **Kelvin** 
>
>#### $\frac{Q_{L}}{Q_{H}}\ =\frac {T_L}{T_H}$
>
>#### $\nu_{rev}\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{T_{L}}{T_{H}}$
