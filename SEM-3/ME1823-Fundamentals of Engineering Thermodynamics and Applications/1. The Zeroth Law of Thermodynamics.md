# Zeroth Law
Introduces the thermodynamic property temperature.

>[!faq]- What is *Temperature* 🌡️
> It's the driving force or the unbalanced potential that drives a flow of heat.

>[!note]- **Definition** of the Zeroth Law
>If two systems A, B are in thermal equilibrium and system A is in equilibrium with another system C. Then B, C are also in thermal equilibrium and all three systems have the same value for the thermodynamic property *temperature*.

>[!warning] Equality of temperature is the **necessary** and **sufficient** condition for thermal equilibrium.
