# First Law
- States that *energy* is **conserved** in nature. ("Energy can't be created and it can't be destroyed")
- Can't be proven mathematically.
- Introduces *3 corollaries*.

>[!note]- **Definition** of the First Law 
>When a system undergoes a thermodynamic *cycle*, sum of the *net heat supplied* to the system from it's surroundings and the *net work input* to the system from its surroundings **must be zero**.
>
>$$\Sigma Q\ +\ \Sigma W\ =\ 0$$

>[!info]- Sign Convention
> ![[Pasted image 20240815103517.png]]
> The final answer to a question shouldn't contain a sign, instead there should be a clear indication on weather energy is transferred to the system or from the system

### Corollary 1
>[!note]- **Definition**
> There exists a property of a closed system such that a change in its value is equal to the *sum of the net heat and work transfer* during any change of state.
> 
> $$\Sigma \ (\ Q\ +\ W\ )\ =\ \Delta X$$

>[!hint]- **Proof** 
>Consider the thermodynamic cycles below
>![[Pasted image 20240815105116.png]]
>>Assume the converse of the corollary 1 is true.
>>$\sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_A\ \neq \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_B$
>
>>Apply first law to cycles AC and BC
>>$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{AC}}\ =\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{BC}\ =\ 0$
>>$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{A}}\ +\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{C}\ =\ \sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{B}}\ +\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{C}$
>>$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{A}}\ =\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{B}$
>>The assumption is wrong
>
>> Hence
>> $$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )}\ =\ \Delta U$$

### Corollary 2
- This corollary brought the concept of *conservation of energy*.
- By extrapolating the considered system to the entire universe the total quantity of energy in the universe can be said to be constant (finite). For this its assumed that the universe has a finite boundary.

>[!note]- **Definition**
>The *internal energy* of a *closed system* remains **unchanged** if the system is *isolated* from its surrounding.
>$$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )}\ =\ \Delta U$$
>If Q=0, W=0, then $\Delta U = 0$

<br>

****
### Corollary 3
>[!note]- **Definition**
>Perpetual motion machine of first kind is **impossible**.
>Because $\sum {Q} +\ \sum {W}\ =\ 0$
