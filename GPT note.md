# Study Notes: Entity-Relationship Model

## Overview

The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a foundational conceptual framework used in database design. It allows for a clear representation of data through entities, their attributes, and relationships. This model is typically represented visually via **ER Diagrams**, which help simplify the process of designing databases.

## Database Design Process

Database design consists of several phases that progressively refine the database structure:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Gather data requirements from users.
2. **Conceptual Design**: Use ER diagrams to map out the relationships and entities.
3. **Logical Design**: Convert the conceptual schema into a relational model.
4. **Physical Design**: Implement the physical layout and optimize the database for performance.

## Key Components of the ER Model

### Entities and Entity Sets

- **Entity**: A "thing" in the real world with distinct existence. Examples: Student, Instructor, Car.
- **Entity Set**: A collection of similar entities.  
  Example: All students in a school form a **Student** entity set.

Each entity is described by a set of attributes, which are the properties of the entity.

**Example of an Entity:**

| **Entity**: Student     |
|-------------------------|
| **Attributes**: ID, Name, Age, Department |

```plaintext
Student
+------------+
| ID         |
| Name       |
| Age        |
| Department |
+------------+
```

- **Primary Key**: One or more attributes that uniquely identify an entity in an entity set (e.g., Student ID).

### Visual Representation:
Entities are represented as rectangles in an ER diagram.

```plaintext
+------------+
|  Student   |
+------------+
|  ID        |
|  Name      |
|  Age       |
|  Dept      |
+------------+
```

---

### Attributes

Attributes describe the properties of an entity:
- **Simple Attribute**: Cannot be divided further (e.g., Name).
- **Composite Attribute**: Composed of multiple subparts (e.g., Address can be split into Street, City, Zip).
- **Derived Attribute**: Can be computed from other attributes (e.g., Age derived from Date of Birth).

**Composite Attribute Example (Address)**:
```plaintext
   Address
   +------------------------+
   | Street, City, Zip Code  |
   +------------------------+
```

### Example Diagram:

**Student Entity with Composite and Simple Attributes**:
```plaintext
+------------+
|  Student   |
+------------+
|  ID        |
|  Name      |
|  Address   |
|   -Street  |
|   -City    |
|   -Zip     |
+------------+
```

---

## Relationships and Relationship Sets

- **Relationship**: Association between two or more entities. Example: **advisor** relationship connects students to their instructors.
- **Relationship Set**: Collection of similar relationships.

### Cardinality:
Relationships between entities can have different types of cardinalities:
- **One-to-One (1:1)**: One entity is related to only one entity in the other set.
- **One-to-Many (1:N)**: One entity is related to many entities in the other set.
- **Many-to-One (N:1)**: Many entities are related to one entity in the other set.
- **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Multiple entities in one set are related to multiple entities in the other set.

**Example of Relationship**:
```plaintext
Instructor - advises - Student
```

### Diagram Representation:
In ER diagrams, relationships are represented by diamonds, and cardinalities by lines connecting the diamond to the rectangles representing entities.

```plaintext
+------------+       advisor       +------------+
|  Student   |---------------------| Instructor |
+------------+                     +------------+
```

**Diagram Example**:  
Here is how you can depict an **advisor** relationship between **Student** and **Instructor** in an ER diagram.

## Mapping Cardinalities

**Cardinality** defines how many instances of one entity relate to another entity in a relationship.

### One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:
Each entity in one entity set corresponds to one and only one entity in another entity set.

**Example**:  
A **Student** has one **Advisor**, and each **Advisor** is assigned to one **Student**.

```plaintext
+------------+       advises        +------------+
|  Student   |---------------------→| Instructor |
+------------+                      +------------+
```

### One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:
One entity in an entity set can be associated with multiple entities in the other set.

**Example**:  
An **Instructor** can advise many **Students**, but each **Student** has only one **Advisor**.

```plaintext
+------------+       advises       +------------+
| Instructor |---------------------→|  Student  |
+------------+                      +------------+
```

### Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship:
Multiple entities from one entity set are associated with multiple entities from another set.

**Example**:  
A **Student** can take multiple **Courses**, and each **Course** can have multiple **Students**.

```plaintext
+------------+       takes          +------------+
|  Student   |----------------------|  Course    |
+------------+                      +------------+
```

---

## Keys and Identifiers

### Primary Key
A **Primary Key** is an attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each entity in an entity set. No two entities can share the same primary key value.

**Example**:
- The `student_id` is the primary key in the **Student** entity set.

```plaintext
+------------+
|  Student   |
+------------+
| *ID        |  ← Primary Key
|  Name      |
|  Age       |
+------------+
```

### Weak Entities

- A **Weak Entity** is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and depends on a **Strong Entity**.
- A **Discriminator** is used to uniquely identify weak entities in combination with the primary key of the strong entity.

**Example**:  
A **Section** entity depends on the **Course** entity, and its unique identifier is a combination of `course_id`, `section_id`, and `year`.

### ER Diagram of Weak Entity:

```plaintext
+------------+       has            +------------+
|   Course   |----------------------|  Section   |
|  (course_id)|                     | (sec_id, year)|
+------------+                      +------------+
```

The **Section** is a weak entity depending on the **Course**.

## Extended ER Features

### Specialization and Generalization

- **Specialization**: Divide an entity set into subclasses.
  - Example: Employees can be specialized into **Faculty** and **Staff**.
  
- **Generalization**: Combine multiple entity sets into a single higher-level set.
  - Example: **Graduate Student** and **Undergraduate Student** can be generalized into **Student**.

### Diagram Representation:

- **Specialization**: Represented by a triangle and an “ISA” relationship.
  
```plaintext
+-------------+
|   Employee  |
+-------------+
      |
      ISA
     /   \
+-----------+ +------------+
| Faculty   | |   Staff    |
+-----------+ +------------+
```

## ER Model to Relational Schema Conversion

The conversion from ER diagrams to relational schema involves:
1. **Entities** becoming tables.
2. **Attributes** becoming columns.
3. **Relationships** becoming foreign keys or separate tables depending on the cardinality.

**Example**:  
For a **Student-Instructor** relationship, the tables would look like this:

| **Table: Student**  | **Table: Instructor** |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| student_id (PK)     | instructor_id (PK)    |
| name                | name                  |
| age                 | department            |

If there is a one-to-many **advises** relationship:
```plaintext
Table: Advisor
+------------+-------------+
| student_id | instructor_id|
+------------+-------------+
```

## Example Exercise: Library Management System

Design an ER diagram for a **Library Management System** where:
- Members borrow books.
- Books can have multiple authors.
- A book may be borrowed by many members.

## Visual Resources
To create your own ER diagrams, you can use:
- **Lucidchart**
- **draw.io**
- **dbdiagram.io**

These tools allow for easy visualization of entities, relationships, and attributes.
