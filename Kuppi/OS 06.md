### **1. Introduction to Multithreading and Concurrency**

#### **Learning Objectives**:
- Understand the difference between threads and processes.
- Identify the benefits of multithreading in modern applications.
- Recognize scenarios where multithreading improves performance.

#### **Teaching Material**:

**Slide 1: Introduction to Multithreading**
- **Definition**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads share the process's resources but run independently.
- **Single-threaded** vs. **Multithreaded** processes:
  - Single-threaded: Only one task at a time.
  - Multithreaded: Multiple tasks running concurrently (e.g., web browsers handle multiple requests).
  
**Slide 2: Benefits of Multithreading**
- **Responsiveness**: An application can continue to function even if part of it is blocked.
- **Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process can easily share memory and resources.
- **Economy**: Threads are lightweight and cheaper to create than processes.
- **Scalability**: Multithreaded programs can efficiently use multicore processors.

**Activity 1: Class Discussion**
- Ask students to brainstorm applications where multithreading improves user experience (e.g., video games, servers, GUI-based applications).

### **2. Key Concepts and Tools**

#### **Learning Objectives**:
- Learn about modern tools and libraries for managing threads and concurrency.
- Use real-world programming examples (Java, C/C++) to understand these concepts.

#### **Teaching Material**:

**Slide 3: Fork-Join Parallelism (Java)**

- **Definition**: A divide-and-conquer approach where a task is split (forked) into subtasks that are processed in parallel, and the results are combined (joined).
  
- **Example**: Fork-Join Framework in Java
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;
    import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;

    class FibonacciTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
        private final int n;

        FibonacciTask(int n) { this.n = n; }

        protected Integer compute() {
            if (n <= 1) return n;
            FibonacciTask task1 = new FibonacciTask(n - 1);
            FibonacciTask task2 = new FibonacciTask(n - 2);
            task1.fork();  // Asynchronous execution
            return task2.compute() + task1.join();  // Combine results
        }
    }

    public class ForkJoinExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
            FibonacciTask task = new FibonacciTask(10);
            int result = pool.invoke(task);
            System.out.println("Fibonacci(10) = " + result);
        }
    }
    ```

**Activity 2: Code Analysis**
- Ask students to modify the code to compute Fibonacci numbers for different values.
- Discuss how the Fork-Join framework leverages parallelism to improve performance.

---

**Slide 4: OpenMP (C/C++)**

- **Definition**: An API for parallel programming in shared-memory environments, using compiler directives to mark sections of code for parallel execution.
  
- **Example**: Parallel for loop in OpenMP (C)
    ```c
    #include <omp.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        int n = 10;
        int arr[10];

        #pragma omp parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = i * i;
            printf("Thread %d computed arr[%d] = %d\n", omp_get_thread_num(), i, arr[i]);
        }

        return 0;
    }
    ```

**Activity 3: Coding Exercise**
- Have students run the OpenMP example and experiment with changing the size of the array and number of threads.
- Discuss how OpenMP handles load balancing and synchronization.

---

**Slide 5: Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**
- **Definition**: Appleâ€™s technology for managing concurrency on macOS and iOS, using dispatch queues to execute tasks in parallel.
  
- **Example**: Using GCD in Swift
    ```swift
    import Foundation

    let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.queue")

    queue.async {
        print("Task running on a background queue.")
    }

    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        print("Task running on the main queue.")
    }
    ```

**Activity 4: Classroom Discussion**
- Ask students to discuss the difference between serial and concurrent queues.
- Explore how GCD simplifies thread management on Apple platforms.

---

**Slide 6: Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB)**
- **Definition**: A C++ library for parallel programming, providing algorithms like `parallel_for`, `parallel_reduce`, and task-based parallelism.
  
- **Example**: Parallel For Loop in TBB
    ```cpp
    #include <tbb/tbb.h>
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        tbb::parallel_for(0, 10, [](int i) {
            std::cout << "Processing index " << i << std::endl;
        });
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### **3. Low-Level Concepts and System Calls**

#### **Learning Objectives**:
- Understand the foundational concepts like `fork()`, `exec()`, signal handling, and thread-local storage.
- Explore how systems manage multithreading at the kernel level.

#### **Teaching Material**:

**Slide 7: Semantics of `fork()` and `exec()`**
- **Definition**:
  - `fork()` creates a new process (child process) by duplicating the calling process.
  - `exec()` replaces the current process image with a new program image.

- **Example**:
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main() {
        pid_t pid = fork();

        if (pid == 0) { execlp("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL); }
        else { wait(NULL); printf("Child complete\n"); }

        return 0;
    }
    ```

**Activity 5: Lab Exercise**
- Have students modify the example to execute other shell commands.
- Discuss the role of process creation in operating systems.

---

**Slide 8: Signal Handling**
- **Definition**: Signals notify a process that a particular event has occurred (e.g., Ctrl+C sends `SIGINT`).
  
- **Example**:
    ```c
    #include <signal.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void signalHandler(int signal_num) {
        printf("Received signal %d\n", signal_num);
    }

    int main() {
        signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);  // Catch Ctrl+C

        while (1) {
            printf("Waiting for signal...\n");
            sleep(1);
        }

        return 0;
    }
    ```

**Activity 6: Signal Simulation**
- Ask students to test signal handling by sending different signals to a running program.
- Discuss how signals are processed in a multithreaded environment.

---

**Slide 9: Thread Cancellation**
- **Definition**: Thread cancellation allows one thread to terminate another.
- **Example**:
    ```c
    #include <pthread.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void *threadFunction(void *arg) {
        while (1) { printf("Thread running...\n"); sleep(1); }
        return NULL;
    }

    int main() {
        pthread_t thread;
        pthread_create(&thread, NULL, threadFunction, NULL);
        sleep(3);
        pthread_cancel(thread);  // Cancel the thread
        pthread_join(thread, NULL);
        printf("Thread cancelled.\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```

**Activity 7: Thread Control**
- Have students experiment with cancellation points in their threads.
- Explore deferred vs. asynchronous thread cancellation.

### **4. Operating System-Specific Threading**

#### **Learning Objectives**:
- Understand how Windows and Linux manage threads at the kernel level.
- Learn about the data structures used to represent threads in each operating system.

#### **Teaching Material**:

**Slide 10: Windows Threads**
- **Key Concepts**: Threads in Windows are created using `CreateThread()`. Each thread contains:
  - Thread ID
  - Register set
  - Kernel and user-mode stacks
  - Private data storage
  
- **Example**:
    ```c
    #include <windows.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    DWORD WINAPI threadFunction(LPVOID param) {
        printf("Thread running\n");
        return 0;
    }

    int main() {
        HANDLE thread = CreateThread(NULL, 0,

 threadFunction, NULL, 0, NULL);
        WaitForSingleObject(thread, INFINITE);
        CloseHandle(thread);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

**Activity 8: Windows API Exploration**
- Have students create and manage multiple threads using the Windows API.

---

**Slide 11: Linux Threads**
- **Key Concepts**: In Linux, threads are created using the `clone()` system call, and threads are referred to as "tasks." The `pthread` library is widely used for POSIX-compliant thread management.
  
- **Example**:
    ```c
    #include <pthread.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void *threadFunction(void *arg) {
        printf("Thread is running\n");
        return NULL;
    }

    int main() {
        pthread_t thread;
        pthread_create(&thread, NULL, threadFunction, NULL);
        pthread_join(thread, NULL);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

**Activity 9: Linux POSIX Threads**
- Have students modify the program to create multiple threads and manage synchronization between them.
