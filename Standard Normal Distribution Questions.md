1. If scores are normally distributed with a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10, what percent of the scores is: 
	1. a. greater than 34? 
	2. b. smaller than 42? 
	3. c. between 28 and 34?

Answer
To solve these problems, we will use the properties of the normal distribution. We'll find the z-scores for the given values and then use the standard normal distribution table (or a calculator) to find the corresponding percentages.

### Given:
- Mean (μ) = 35
- Standard deviation (σ) = 10

### Z-score formula:
\[ z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \]

### a. Percent of scores greater than 34

1. **Calculate the z-score** for X = 34:
   \[
   z = \frac{(34 - 35)}{10} = \frac{-1}{10} = -0.1
   \]

2. **Find the cumulative probability** for z = -0.1 using a z-table or calculator:
   - The cumulative probability for z = -0.1 is approximately 0.4602.

3. **Calculate the percentage greater than 34**:
   \[
   P(X > 34) = 1 - P(Z < -0.1) = 1 - 0.4602 = 0.5398
   \]
   - This means approximately **53.98%** of the scores are greater than 34.

### b. Percent of scores smaller than 42

1. **Calculate the z-score** for X = 42:
   \[
   z = \frac{(42 - 35)}{10} = \frac{7}{10} = 0.7
   \]

2. **Find the cumulative probability** for z = 0.7:
   - The cumulative probability for z = 0.7 is approximately 0.7580.

3. **Calculate the percentage smaller than 42**:
   \[
   P(X < 42) \approx 0.7580
   \]
   - This means approximately **75.80%** of the scores are smaller than 42.

### c. Percent of scores between 28 and 34

1. **Calculate the z-scores**:
   - For X = 28:
     \[
     z = \frac{(28 - 35)}{10} = \frac{-7}{10} = -0.7
     \]
   - For X = 34 (already calculated):
     \[
     z = -0.1
     \]

2. **Find the cumulative probabilities**:
   - For z = -0.7, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.2420.
   - For z = -0.1, we already found it to be approximately 0.4602.

3. **Calculate the percentage between 28 and 34**:
   \[
   P(28 < X < 34) = P(Z < -0.1) - P(Z < -0.7) = 0.4602 - 0.2420 = 0.2182
   \]
   - This means approximately **21.82%** of the scores are between 28 and 34.

### Summary:
- a. Greater than 34: **53.98%**
- b. Smaller than 42: **75.80%**
- c. Between 28 and 34: **21.82%**
