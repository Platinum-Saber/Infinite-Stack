1. If scores are normally distributed with a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10, what percent of the scores is: 
	1. a. greater than 34? 
	2. b. smaller than 42? 
	3. c. between 28 and 34?

1. What are the mean and standard deviation of the standard normal distribution? 
	1. (b) What would be the mean and standard deviation of a distribution created by multiplying the standard normal distribution by 8 and then adding 75?
