### System Requirements for the AI-Powered Drug Adherence Monitoring App
1. Functional Requirements:
1.1 User Authentication and Profile Management:
Users (patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers) must be able to create and manage their accounts.
The system should support multiple user roles (patient, doctor, caregiver).
Patients can input their medication schedules, doses, and timing.
Doctors or caregivers can access patient profiles and monitor adherence.
1.2 Medication Schedule and Reminders:
Users should be able to input the name of their medications, dosage, frequency, and time.
The app should send automatic reminders to patients based on their medication schedule.
Reminders should include notifications, SMS, or push notifications.
1.3 Image Recognition for Pill Identification:
The app should use AI-based image recognition to identify pills.
Patients can take a picture of their pills, and the system will match them with the prescribed medication.
The app should alert patients if they are taking the wrong medication.
1.4 Wearable Integration:
The app should integrate with wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers) to track health metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, and activity after medication intake.
The AI can analyze the data from wearables to assess the effect of the medication and alert if any anomalies are detected.
1.5 AI for Predictive Adherence Analysis:
The app should use AI to predict medication non-adherence by analyzing user behavior and health data.
The system should flag users who are at high risk of missing doses and notify caregivers or doctors.
1.6 Reporting and Analytics:
Generate adherence reports that can be shared with healthcare providers.
Track patterns of adherence/non-adherence and present them in easy-to-understand graphs and metrics.
Provide health insights based on wearable data and medication adherence.
1.7 Integration with Medical Records (Optional):
The app should have the ability to integrate with electronic medical records (EMRs) for a seamless experience.
Automatically update medical records with medication adherence data for healthcare providers.
1.8 Security and Privacy:
The app should adhere to privacy standards like HIPAA (USA) or GDPR (EU) to protect patient data.
All health and personal information should be encrypted and stored securely.
1.9 Emergency Alerts:
If the wearable data or patient input indicates a critical health condition (e.g., sudden changes in heart rate or missed critical doses), the app should send emergency alerts to a designated caregiver or healthcare provider.

Software Requirements:
1. Mobile App Development Framework:
Frontend:
Flutter or React Native (for cross-platform iOS/Android development).
Swift for iOS (if native development is preferred).
Kotlin for Android (if native development is preferred).
Backend:
Node.js or Python Django/Flask for backend API development.
FastAPI for building lightweight, fast backend services.
Firebase or AWS Amplify for real-time notifications and cloud functions.
2. AI Tools & Libraries:
TensorFlow Lite or CoreML for implementing AI on mobile for pill identification.
OpenCV for image processing and recognition of pills.
scikit-learn for predictive analytics (adherence behavior prediction).
Keras for developing the predictive adherence model.
3. Image Recognition (Pill Identification):
Google Cloud Vision API or Amazon Rekognition for image recognition, in case you want to leverage cloud-based AI for better accuracy.
Custom-trained CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) using TensorFlow or PyTorch to identify pills.
4. Wearable Integration:
Apple HealthKit (iOS) and Google Fit API (Android) for wearable data integration.
Fitbit API or Garmin API for integrating with specific wearable devices.
5. Database:
PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data storage (patient info, medication schedule).
Firebase or MongoDB for real-time data and adherence tracking.
Time-series databases like InfluxDB for storing and analyzing health metrics over time.
6. Push Notifications:
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for sending real-time medication reminders.
Twilio for SMS notifications, in case users prefer text reminders.
7. Cloud and Hosting:
AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable cloud hosting, data storage, and AI model deployment.
Heroku for quick deployment in the early stages of development.
8. Data Privacy and Security:
OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
AES-256 encryption for securing sensitive patient data.
SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
9. Analytics and Reporting Tools:
Tableau or Google Data Studio for generating and visualizing adherence reports.
Matplotlib or Plotly for integrating graphs directly into the app.
10. Testing and Debugging Tools:
Jest or JUnit for unit testing.
Appium for mobile app automation testing.
Postman for API testing.
