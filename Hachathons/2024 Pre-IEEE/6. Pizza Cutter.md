# Pizza Cutting Robot Problem

The **Slicematic** is a pizza-cutting robot. The robot takes a series of degree offsets as inputs and uses these to slice the pizza along the diameter starting at each offset. Your task is to count the number of pieces of pizza that will result after the robot is done cutting. The image below shows some example offsets. The first image results in 4 pieces, and the second has 6 pieces.

---

### Notes:

- As shown in the image, the slicematic robot can take degree values that are more than 360 degrees.
- A positive degree value represents clockwise rotation. The robot can also take a negative value as a degree, representing counterclockwise rotation.
- If the robot makes two equivalent slicing offsets, e.g., 0 and 180 degrees, only **one** cut will be made.
- All slices will intersect in the center of the pizza.

## Standard Input:

- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.
- Each test case is a single line of space-separated integers. The test case begins with an integer $N$, which is the number of slicing offsets in the test, followed by $N$ integers, $D_1, D_2, \dots, D_N$, each describing an offset the robot will use to slice the pizza.

## Standard Output:

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of pieces of pizza that will result after the slicematic makes all of the slices.

## Constraints and Notes:

- $1 \leq T \leq 30$
- $0 \leq N \leq 10^4$
- $-10^6 \leq D_i \leq 10^6$, for all $i, 1 \leq i \leq N$

            else
            {
                // Handle negative values
                if (a < -180)
                {
                    a = a + 360;
                }
                else

                offsets.insert(a);
