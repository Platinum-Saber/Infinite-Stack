Molly and Bob want to go on holiday, but they need to be careful since their budget is low. They need to make a wise choice for their destination. They asked a travel agency about holiday offers for the next few days. The agency responded with a list of flights. Each flight starts in some city \(s\) and goes to another city \(t\) with a fixed cost.

A trip from city \(u_0\) to city \(u_k\) is a sequence of flights \((u_0, u_1), (u_1, u_2), \ldots, (u_{k-1}, u_k)\), and its cost is the sum of the costs of all the flights used.

Molly and Bob are considering different destinations. You need to find the trip to each chosen destination with the lowest price possible, such that it is within their budget, or report that there is no such trip.

### **Input:**

- The first line contains the number of offers \(n\), the starting city \(src\), and the total budget \(b\).
- Then \(n\) lines follow, each containing two cities \(s\) and \(t\), and the cost of the ticket from city \(s\) to city \(t\).
- The \((n + 1)\)-th line contains the number of queries \(q\), followed by \(q\) lines, each containing one destination.

### **Output:**

For each destination, print the minimum cost of a trip from the starting city to it. If no trip within the budget exists, print **NONE**.

---

### **Constraints and Notes:**

- \(1 \leq n, q \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\)
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the trip network.
- The name of each city is at most 20 characters long.

The task involves finding the shortest path from the starting city to multiple destinations while ensuring the total trip cost does not exceed the budget.
