# Board Game Scheduling Problem

There are $N$ people who want to play board games. For each person $i$ you are given two values $A_i$ and $B_i$, representing a time interval when they are available to play.

You should partition the people in at most $M$ groups. For each group, they can play together only when all the members of the group are available. It is possible that a group will not play at all, because of the different availability of the members.

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the total time spent playing, for all the groups.

## Standard input

The first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$.

Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ representing the availability of the $i$-th person.

## Standard output

Print a single number representing the maximum sum of time spent playing.

## Constraints and notes

- $1 \leq N \leq 6000$
- $1 \leq M \leq N$
- $1 \leq A_i < B_i \leq 10^6$ for every $1 \leq i \leq N$
- It is possible to have groups with a single person. In that case, we will consider that person plays Solitaire, so we will count the entire interval $[A_i, B_i]$ towards the answer.

## Partial Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int max_playing_time(int N, int M, vector<pair<int, int>>& intervals) {
    // Sort intervals by end time
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.second < b.second;
    });

    // Calculate maximum overlap for each suffix
    vector<int> max_overlap(N + 1, 0);
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int max_val = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < N; ++j) {
            int overlap = min(intervals[i].second, intervals[j].second) - max(intervals[i].first, intervals[j].first);
            max_val = max(max_val, overlap);
        }
        max_overlap[i] = max_val;
    }

    // Initialize DP table
    vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(M + 1, 0));

    // Fill DP table
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= min(i, M); ++j) {
            if (j == 1) {
                dp[i][j] = max_overlap[0];
            } else {
                for (int k = j - 1; k < i; ++k) {
                    int overlap = min(intervals[k].second, intervals[i - 1].second) - max(intervals[k].first, intervals[i - 1].first);
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j - 1] + overlap);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[N][M];
}

int main() {
    int N, M;
    cin >> N >> M;
    vector<pair<int, int>> intervals(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        cin >> intervals[i].first >> intervals[i].second;
    }

    // Solve and print result
    cout << max_playing_time(N, M, intervals) << endl;

    return 0;
}
