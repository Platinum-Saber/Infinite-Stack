Alice has bought a new radio and decided to spy on her friend Bob, who is communicating with his friends late at night. The message Bob sends out can be interpreted as a string of $\mathcal N$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet. But Bob and his friends have agreed to scramble the message.

In order to decode the real message, Alice has to perform some operations. Each operation consists of choosing a group of MM consecutive equal letters and deleting them from the message. Alice should perform operations as long as possible, meaning that as long as she finds $\mathcal M$ consecutive equal letters, she should delete them.

## Standard input

- The first line contains two integers NN and MM.
The second line contains Bob's message, a string of length NN.

## Standard output

Print a string on a single line, representing the decoded message.

## Constraints and notes

- 1≤M≤N≤1051≤M≤N≤105
- It can be proven the result is unique, regardless of the order of operations Alice chooses to perform.
